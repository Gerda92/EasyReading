<p><span id="en91">A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to understand his work. </span></p>
<p><span id="en94">Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor.  </span><span id="en96">His parents were very hard-working and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five children in only two rooms.  </span><span id="en98">The father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious character. </span></p>
<p><span id="en101">Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering.  </span><span id="en103">There he had already begun his first work, "Poor Folk." </span></p>
<p><span id="en106">This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and was received with acclamations.  </span><span id="en108">The shy, unknown youth found himself instantly something of a celebrity.  </span><span id="en110">A brilliant and successful career seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed.  </span><span id="en112">In 1849 he was arrested. </span></p>
<p><span id="en115">Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier and Proudhon.  </span><span id="en117">He was accused of "taking part in conversations against the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing of the intention to set up a printing press."  </span><span id="en119">Under Nicholas I.  </span><span id="en121">(that "stern and just man," as Maurice Baring calls him) this was enough, and he was condemned to death.  </span><span id="en123">After eight months' imprisonment he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot.  </span><span id="en125">Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: "They snapped words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to death.  </span><span id="en127">Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes, to suffer execution.  </span><span id="en129">Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me.  </span><span id="en131">I thought of you and your dear ones and I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid them farewell.  </span><span id="en133">Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared us our lives."  </span><span id="en135">The sentence was commuted to hard labour. </span></p>
<p><span id="en138">One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and never regained his sanity. </span></p>
<p><span id="en141">The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on Dostoevsky's mind.  </span><span id="en143">Though his religious temper led him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.  </span><span id="en145">He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of inflicting such torture.  </span><span id="en147">Then followed four years of penal servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where he began the "Dead House," and some years of service in a disciplinary battalion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en150">He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he suffered for the rest of his life.  </span><span id="en152">The fits occurred three or four times a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain.  </span><span id="en154">In 1859 he was allowed to return to Russia.  </span><span id="en156">He started a journal—"Vremya," which was forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding.  </span><span id="en158">In 1864 he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail.  </span><span id="en160">He was in terrible poverty, yet he took upon himself the payment of his brother's debts.  </span><span id="en162">He started another journal—"The Epoch," which within a few months was also prohibited.  </span><span id="en164">He was weighed down by debt, his brother's family was dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is said never to have corrected his work.  </span><span id="en166">The later years of his life were much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife. </span></p>
<p><span id="en169">In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary demonstrations of love and honour. </span></p>
<p><span id="en172">A few months later Dostoevsky died.  </span><span id="en174">He was followed to the grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who "gave the hapless man the funeral of a king."  </span><span id="en176">He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en179">In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling inspired by Dostoevsky: "He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight impresses us as wisdom...  </span><span id="en181">that wisdom of the heart which we seek that we may learn from it how to live.  </span><span id="en183">All his other gifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he became great." </span></p>

<p><span id="en189">On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S.  </span><span id="en191">Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K.  </span><span id="en193">bridge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en196">He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase.  </span><span id="en198">His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room.  </span><span id="en200">The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open.  </span><span id="en202">And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed.  </span><span id="en204">He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en207">This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria.  </span><span id="en209">He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all.  </span><span id="en211">He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him.  </span><span id="en213">He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so.  </span><span id="en215">Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him.  </span><span id="en217">But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie—no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen. </span></p>
<p><span id="en220">This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears. </span></p>
<p><span id="en222">"I want to attempt a thing  </span><i><span id="en223">like that </span></i><span id="en224">  </span><span id="en225">and am frightened by these trifles," he thought, with an odd smile. " </span><span id="en227">Hm...  </span><span id="en229">yes, all is in a man's hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom.  </span><span id="en231">It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of.  </span><span id="en233">Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most....  </span><span id="en235">But I am talking too much.  </span><span id="en237">It's because I chatter that I do nothing.  </span><span id="en239">Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing.  </span><span id="en241">I've learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking...  </span><span id="en243">of Jack the Giant-killer.  </span><span id="en245">Why am I going there now?  </span><span id="en246">Am I capable of  </span><i><span id="en247">that </span></i><span id="en248">? Is  </span><i><span id="en249">that </span></i><span id="en250">  </span><span id="en251">serious?  </span><span id="en253">It is not serious at all.  </span><span id="en255">It's simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything!  </span><span id="en257">Yes, maybe it is a plaything." </span></p>
<p><span id="en263">The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked painfully upon the young man's already overwrought nerves.  </span><span id="en265">The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture.  </span><span id="en267">An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man's refined face.  </span><span id="en269">He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair.  </span><span id="en271">Soon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it.  </span><span id="en273">From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed.  </span><span id="en275">At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food. </span></p>
<p><span id="en278">He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags.  </span><span id="en280">In that quarter of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise.  </span><span id="en282">Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise.  </span><span id="en284">But there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least of all in the street.  </span><span id="en286">It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time.  </span><span id="en288">And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: "Hey there, German hatter" bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat.  </span><span id="en290">It was a tall round hat from Zimmerman's, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion.  </span><span id="en292">Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en295">"I knew it," he muttered in confusion, "I thought so!  </span><span id="en297">That's the worst of all!  </span><span id="en299">Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan.  </span><span id="en301">Yes, my hat is too noticeable....  </span><span id="en303">It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable....  </span><span id="en305">With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing.  </span><span id="en307">Nobody wears such a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered....  </span><span id="en309">What matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them a clue.  </span><span id="en311">For this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible....  </span><span id="en313">Trifles, trifles are what matter!  </span><span id="en315">Why, it's just such trifles that always ruin everything...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en318">He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty.  </span><span id="en320">He had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams.  </span><span id="en322">At the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness.  </span><span id="en324">Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this "hideous" dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still did not realise this himself.  </span><span id="en326">He was positively going now for a "rehearsal" of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more and more violent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en329">With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the street.  </span><span id="en331">This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all kinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.  </span><span id="en333">There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house.  </span><span id="en335">Three or four door-keepers were employed on the building.  </span><span id="en337">The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase.  </span><span id="en339">It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded. </span></p>
<p><span id="en342">"If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that I were really going to do it?"  </span><span id="en344">he could not help asking himself as he reached the fourth storey.  </span><span id="en346">There his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat.  </span><span id="en348">He knew that the flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his family.  </span><span id="en350">This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. " </span><span id="en352">That's a good thing anyway," he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old woman's flat.  </span><span id="en354">The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper.  </span><span id="en356">The little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that.  </span><span id="en358">He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him....  </span><span id="en360">He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained by now.  </span><span id="en362">In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.  </span><span id="en364">But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and opened the door wide.  </span><span id="en366">The young man stepped into the dark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen.  </span><span id="en368">The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him.  </span><span id="en370">She was a diminutive, withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose.  </span><span id="en372">Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it.  </span><span id="en374">Round her thin long neck, which looked like a hen's leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow with age.  </span><span id="en376">The old woman coughed and groaned at every instant.  </span><span id="en378">The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en381">"Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago," the young man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more polite. </span></p>
<p><span id="en384">"I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here," the old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en387">"And here...  </span><span id="en389">I am again on the same errand," Raskolnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman's mistrust. " </span><span id="en391">Perhaps she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other time," he thought with an uneasy feeling. </span></p>
<p><span id="en393">The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass in front of her: </span></p>
<p><span id="en395">"Step in, my good sir." </span></p>
<p><span id="en398">The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun. </span></p>
<p><span id="en400">"So the sun will shine like this  </span><i><span id="en401">then </span></i><span id="en402">  </span><span id="en403">too!"  </span><span id="en405">flashed as it were by chance through Raskolnikov's mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement.  </span><span id="en407">But there was nothing special in the room.  </span><span id="en409">The furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands—that was all.  </span><span id="en411">In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon.  </span><span id="en413">Everything was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished; everything shone. </span></p>
<p><span id="en417">"Lizaveta's work," thought the young man.  </span><span id="en419">There was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en422">"It's in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness," Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in which stood the old woman's bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before.  </span><span id="en424">These two rooms made up the whole flat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en427">"What do you want?"  </span><span id="en429">the old woman said severely, coming into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en432">"I've brought something to pawn here," and he drew out of his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel. </span></p>
<p><span id="en435">"But the time is up for your last pledge.  </span><span id="en437">The month was up the day before yesterday." </span></p>
<p><span id="en440">"I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little." </span></p>
<p><span id="en443">"But that's for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell your pledge at once." </span></p>
<p><span id="en446">"How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en449">"You come with such trifles, my good sir, it's scarcely worth anything.  </span><span id="en451">I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler's for a rouble and a half." </span></p>
<p><span id="en454">"Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father's.  </span><span id="en456">I shall be getting some money soon." </span></p>
<p><span id="en459">"A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en462">"A rouble and a half!"  </span><span id="en464">cried the young man. </span></p>
<p><span id="en467">"Please yourself"—and the old woman handed him back the watch.  </span><span id="en469">The young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming. </span></p>
<p><span id="en472">"Hand it over," he said roughly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en475">The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room.  </span><span id="en477">The young man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking.  </span><span id="en479">He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers. </span></p>
<p><span id="en482">"It must be the top drawer," he reflected. " </span><span id="en484">So she carries the keys in a pocket on the right.  </span><span id="en486">All in one bunch on a steel ring....  </span><span id="en488">And there's one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches; that can't be the key of the chest of drawers...  </span><span id="en490">then there must be some other chest or strong-box...  </span><span id="en492">that's worth knowing.  </span><span id="en494">Strong-boxes always have keys like that...  </span><span id="en496">but how degrading it all is." </span></p>
<p><span id="en499">The old woman came back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en502">"Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance.  </span><span id="en504">But for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning in advance.  </span><span id="en506">That makes thirty-five copecks altogether.  </span><span id="en508">So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch.  </span><span id="en510">Here it is." </span></p>
<p><span id="en513">"What!  </span><span id="en515">only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en518">"Just so." </span></p>
<p><span id="en521">The young man did not dispute it and took the money.  </span><span id="en523">He looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know what. </span></p>
<p><span id="en526">"I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona Ivanovna—a valuable thing—silver—a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it back from a friend..."  </span><span id="en528">he broke off in confusion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en531">"Well, we will talk about it then, sir." </span></p>
<p><span id="en534">"Good-bye—are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with you?"  </span><span id="en536">He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage. </span></p>
<p><span id="en539">"What business is she of yours, my good sir?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en542">"Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked.  </span><span id="en544">You are too quick....  </span><span id="en546">Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna." </span></p>
<p><span id="en549">Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion.  </span><span id="en551">This confusion became more and more intense.  </span><span id="en553">As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought.  </span><span id="en555">When he was in the street he cried out, "Oh, God, how loathsome it all is!  </span><span id="en557">and can I, can I possibly....  </span><span id="en559">No, it's nonsense, it's rubbish!"  </span><span id="en561">he added resolutely. " </span><span id="en563">And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?  </span><span id="en565">What filthy things my heart is capable of.  </span><span id="en567">Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome! </span><span id="en569">—and for a whole month I've been...."  </span><span id="en571">But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation.  </span><span id="en573">The feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness.  </span><span id="en575">He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next street.  </span><span id="en577">Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.  </span><span id="en579">At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they mounted the steps.  </span><span id="en581">Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once.  </span><span id="en583">Till that moment he had never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst.  </span><span id="en585">He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food.  </span><span id="en587">He sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful.  </span><span id="en589">At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear. </span></p>
<p><span id="en592">"All that's nonsense," he said hopefully, "and there is nothing in it all to worry about!  </span><span id="en594">It's simply physical derangement.  </span><span id="en596">Just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one moment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm!  </span><span id="en598">Phew, how utterly petty it all is!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en601">But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room.  </span><span id="en603">But even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal. </span></p>
<p><span id="en606">There were few people at the time in the tavern.  </span><span id="en608">Besides the two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time.  </span><span id="en610">Their departure left the room quiet and rather empty.  </span><span id="en612">The persons still in the tavern were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat.  </span><span id="en613">He was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these: </span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><span id="en614">"His wife a year he fondly loved </span><br><span id="en615">
 </span><span id="en616">His wife a—a year he—fondly loved." </span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><span id="en618">Or suddenly waking up again: </span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><span id="en619">"Walking along the crowded row </span><br><span id="en620">
 </span><span id="en621">He met the one he used to know." </span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><span id="en624">But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations.  </span><span id="en626">There was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk.  </span><span id="en628">He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and looking round at the company.  </span><span id="en630">He, too, appeared to be in some agitation. </span></p>

<p><span id="en634">Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided society of every sort, more especially of late.  </span><span id="en636">But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people.  </span><span id="en638">Something new seemed to be taking place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company.  </span><span id="en640">He was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern. </span></p>
<p><span id="en643">The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person.  </span><span id="en645">He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock.  </span><span id="en647">At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted.  </span><span id="en649">On the counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad.  </span><span id="en651">It was insufferably close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk. </span></p>
<p><span id="en654">There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the first moment, before a word is spoken.  </span><span id="en656">Such was the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired clerk.  </span><span id="en658">The young man often recalled this impression afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment.  </span><span id="en660">He looked repeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation.  </span><span id="en662">At the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to converse.  </span><span id="en664">He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height, and stoutly built.  </span><span id="en666">His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks.  </span><span id="en668">But there was something very strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling—perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness.  </span><span id="en670">He was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability.  </span><span id="en672">A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat.  </span><span id="en674">Like a clerk, he wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush.  </span><span id="en676">And there was something respectable and like an official about his manner too.  </span><span id="en678">But he was restless; he ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky table.  </span><span id="en679">At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and resolutely: </span></p>
<p><span id="en681">"May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?  </span><span id="en683">Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking.  </span><span id="en685">I have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular counsellor in rank.  </span><span id="en687">Marmeladov—such is my name; titular counsellor.  </span><span id="en689">I make bold to inquire—have you been in the service?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en692">"No, I am studying," answered the young man, somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed.  </span><span id="en694">In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en697">"A student then, or formerly a student," cried the clerk. " </span><span id="en699">Just what I thought!  </span><span id="en701">I'm a man of experience, immense experience, sir," and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. " </span><span id="en703">You've been a student or have attended some learned institution!...  </span><span id="en705">But allow me...."  </span><span id="en707">He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside the young man, facing him a little sideways.  </span><span id="en709">He was drunk, but spoke fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his sentences and drawling his words.  </span><span id="en711">He pounced upon Raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month. </span></p>
<p><span id="en714">"Honoured sir," he began almost with solemnity, "poverty is not a vice, that's a true saying.  </span><span id="en716">Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue, and that that's even truer.  </span><span id="en718">But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice.  </span><span id="en720">In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary—never—no one.  </span><span id="en722">For beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself.  </span><span id="en724">Hence the pot-house!  </span><span id="en726">Honoured sir, a month ago Mr.  </span><span id="en728">Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very different matter from me!  </span><span id="en730">Do you understand?  </span><span id="en732">Allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en735">"No, I have not happened to," answered Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en737">What do you mean?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en740">"Well, I've just come from one and it's the fifth night I've slept so...."  </span><span id="en742">He filled his glass, emptied it and paused.  </span><span id="en744">Bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair.  </span><span id="en746">It seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.  </span><span id="en748">His hands, particularly, were filthy.  </span><span id="en750">They were fat and red, with black nails. </span></p>
<p><span id="en753">His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest.  </span><span id="en755">The boys at the counter fell to sniggering.  </span><span id="en757">The innkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the "funny fellow" and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.  </span><span id="en759">Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern.  </span><span id="en761">This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home.  </span><span id="en763">Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration. </span></p>
<p><span id="en766">"Funny fellow!"  </span><span id="en768">pronounced the innkeeper. " </span><span id="en770">And why don't you work, why aren't you at your duty, if you are in the service?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en773">"Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir," Marmeladov went on, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put that question to him. " </span><span id="en775">Why am I not at my duty?  </span><span id="en777">Does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm I am?  </span><span id="en779">A month ago when Mr.  </span><span id="en781">Lebeziatnikov beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn't I suffer?  </span><span id="en783">Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you...  </span><span id="en785">hm...  </span><span id="en787">well, to petition hopelessly for a loan?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en790">"Yes, it has.  </span><span id="en792">But what do you mean by hopelessly?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en795">"Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it.  </span><span id="en797">You know, for instance, beforehand with positive certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?  </span><span id="en799">For he knows of course that I shan't pay it back.  </span><span id="en801">From compassion?  </span><span id="en803">But Mr.  </span><span id="en805">Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that's what is done now in England, where there is political economy.  </span><span id="en807">Why, I ask you, should he give it to me?  </span><span id="en809">And yet though I know beforehand that he won't, I set off to him and..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en812">"Why do you go?"  </span><span id="en814">put in Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en817">"Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go!  </span><span id="en819">For every man must have somewhere to go.  </span><span id="en821">Since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere!  </span><span id="en823">When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had to go...  </span><span id="en825">(for my daughter has a yellow passport)," he added in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man. " </span><span id="en827">No matter, sir, no matter!"  </span><span id="en829">he went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled—"No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all that is secret is made open.  </span><span id="en831">And I accept it all, not with contempt, but with humility.  </span><span id="en833">So be it!  </span><span id="en835">So be it!  </span><span id="en837">'Behold the man! </span><span id="en839">' Excuse me, young man, can you....  </span><span id="en840">No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not  </span><i><span id="en841">can </span></i><span id="en842"> you but  </span><i><span id="en843">dare </span></i><span id="en844">  </span><span id="en845">you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en850">The young man did not answer a word. </span></p>
<p><span id="en853">"Well," the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. " </span><span id="en855">Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady!  </span><span id="en857">I have the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer's daughter.  </span><span id="en859">Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education.  </span><span id="en861">And yet...  </span><span id="en863">oh, if only she felt for me!  </span><span id="en865">Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him!  </span><span id="en867">But Katerina Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust....  </span><span id="en869">And yet, although I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity—for I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man," he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again—"but, my God, if she would but once....  </span><span id="en871">But no, no!  </span><span id="en873">It's all in vain and it's no use talking!  </span><span id="en875">No use talking!  </span><span id="en877">For more than once, my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but...  </span><span id="en879">such is my fate and I am a beast by nature!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en882">"Rather!"  </span><span id="en884">assented the innkeeper yawning.  </span><span id="en886">Marmeladov struck his fist resolutely on the table. </span></p>
<p><span id="en889">"Such is my fate!  </span><span id="en891">Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very stockings for drink?  </span><span id="en893">Not her shoes—that would be more or less in the order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!  </span><span id="en895">Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too.  </span><span id="en897">We have three little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she's been used to cleanliness from a child.  </span><span id="en899">But her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and I feel it!  </span><span id="en901">Do you suppose I don't feel it?  </span><span id="en903">And the more I drink the more I feel it.  </span><span id="en905">That's why I drink too.  </span><span id="en907">I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink....  </span><span id="en909">I drink so that I may suffer twice as much!"  </span><span id="en911">And as though in despair he laid his head down on the table. </span></p>
<p><span id="en914">"Young man," he went on, raising his head again, "in your face I seem to read some trouble of mind.  </span><span id="en916">When you came in I read it, and that was why I addressed you at once.  </span><span id="en918">For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man of feeling and education.  </span><span id="en920">Know then that my wife was educated in a high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.  </span><span id="en922">The medal...  </span><span id="en924">well, the medal of course was sold—long ago, hm...  </span><span id="en926">but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady.  </span><span id="en928">And although she is most continually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy days that are gone.  </span><span id="en930">I don't condemn her for it, I don't blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes.  </span><span id="en932">Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, proud and determined.  </span><span id="en934">She scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won't allow herself to be treated with disrespect.  </span><span id="en936">That's why she would not overlook Mr.  </span><span id="en938">Lebeziatnikov's rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows.  </span><span id="en940">She was a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the other.  </span><span id="en942">She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her father's house.  </span><span id="en944">She was exceedingly fond of her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he died.  </span><span id="en946">He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having once been happy....  </span><span id="en948">And she was left at his death with three children in a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups and downs of all sort, I don't feel equal to describing it even.  </span><span id="en950">Her relations had all thrown her off.  </span><span id="en952">And she was proud, too, excessively proud....  </span><span id="en954">And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering.  </span><span id="en956">You can judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my wife.  </span><span id="en958">But she did!  </span><span id="en960">Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she married me!  </span><span id="en962">For she had nowhere to turn!  </span><span id="en964">Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?  </span><span id="en966">No, that you don't understand yet....  </span><span id="en968">And for a whole year, I performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this" (he tapped the jug with his finger), "for I have feelings.  </span><span id="en970">But even so, I could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch it!...  </span><span id="en972">It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital, adorned with innumerable monuments.  </span><span id="en974">Here I obtained a situation....  </span><span id="en976">I obtained it and I lost it again.  </span><span id="en978">Do you understand?  </span><span id="en980">This time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come out....  </span><span id="en982">We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel's; and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.  </span><span id="en984">There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves.  </span><span id="en986">Dirt and disorder, a perfect Bedlam...  </span><span id="en988">hm...  </span><span id="en990">yes...  </span><span id="en992">And meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won't speak of.  </span><span id="en994">For, though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited lady, irritable and short-tempered....  </span><span id="en996">Yes.  </span><span id="en998">But it's no use going over that!  </span><span id="en1000">Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education.  </span><span id="en1002">I did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable books, and what books we had...  </span><span id="en1004">hm, anyway we have not even those now, so all our instruction came to an end.  </span><span id="en1006">We stopped at Cyrus of Persia.  </span><span id="en1008">Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through Mr.  </span><span id="en1010">Lebeziatnikov, Lewes' Physiology—do you know it? </span><span id="en1012">—and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that's the whole of her education.  </span><span id="en1014">And now may I venture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with a private question.  </span><span id="en1016">Do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work?  </span><span id="en1018">Not fifteen farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant!  </span><span id="en1020">And what's more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor—have you heard of him? </span><span id="en1022">—has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were put in askew.  </span><span id="en1024">And there are the little ones hungry....  </span><span id="en1026">And Katerina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that disease: 'Here you live with us,' says she, 'you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help. </span><span id="en1028">' And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days!  </span><span id="en1030">I was lying at the time...  </span><span id="en1032">well, what of it!  </span><span id="en1034">I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle creature with a soft little voice...  </span><span id="en1036">fair hair and such a pale, thin little face).  </span><span id="en1038">She said: 'Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing like that? </span><span id="en1040">' And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady.  </span><span id="en1042">'And why not? </span><span id="en1044">' said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer, 'you are something mighty precious to be so careful of! </span><span id="en1046">' But don't blame her, don't blame her, honoured sir, don't blame her!  </span><span id="en1048">She was not herself when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything else....  </span><span id="en1050">For that's Katerina Ivanovna's character, and when children cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once.  </span><span id="en1052">At six o'clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine o'clock she came back.  </span><span id="en1054">She walked straight up to Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her in silence.  </span><span id="en1055">She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she simply picked up our big green  </span><i><span id="en1056">drap de dames </span></i><span id="en1057"> shawl (we have a shawl, made of  </span><i><span id="en1058">drap de dames </span></i><span id="en1060">), put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering....  </span><span id="en1062">And I went on lying there, just as before....  </span><span id="en1064">And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence go up to Sonia's little bed; she was on her knees all the evening kissing Sonia's feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell asleep in each other's arms...  </span><span id="en1066">together, together...  </span><span id="en1068">yes...  </span><span id="en1070">and I...  </span><span id="en1072">lay drunk." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1077">Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him.  </span><span id="en1079">Then he hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1082">"Since then, sir," he went on after a brief pause—"Since then, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil-intentioned persons—in all which Darya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect—since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us.  </span><span id="en1084">For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr.  </span><span id="en1086">Lebeziatnikov too...  </span><span id="en1088">hm....  </span><span id="en1090">All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia's account.  </span><span id="en1092">At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity: 'how,' said he, 'can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that? </span><span id="en1094">' And Katerina Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her...  </span><span id="en1096">and so that's how it happened.  </span><span id="en1098">And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can....  </span><span id="en1100">She has a room at the Kapernaumovs' the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palates too.  </span><span id="en1102">And his wife, too, has a cleft palate.  </span><span id="en1104">They all live in one room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off....  </span><span id="en1106">Hm...  </span><span id="en1108">yes...  </span><span id="en1110">very poor people and all with cleft palates...  </span><span id="en1112">yes.  </span><span id="en1114">Then I got up in the morning, and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch.  </span><span id="en1116">His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you know him?  </span><span id="en1118">No?  </span><span id="en1120">Well, then, it's a man of God you don't know.  </span><span id="en1122">He is wax...  </span><span id="en1124">wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!...  </span><span id="en1126">His eyes were dim when he heard my story.  </span><span id="en1128">'Marmeladov, once already you have deceived my expectations...  </span><span id="en1130">I'll take you once more on my own responsibility'—that's what he said, 'remember,' he said, 'and now you can go. </span><span id="en1132">' I kissed the dust at his feet—in thought only, for in reality he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of modern political and enlightened ideas.  </span><span id="en1134">I returned home, and when I announced that I'd been taken back into the service and should receive a salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1137">Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement.  </span><span id="en1139">At that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing "The Hamlet" were heard in the entry.  </span><span id="en1141">The room was filled with noise.  </span><span id="en1143">The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.  </span><span id="en1145">Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.  </span><span id="en1147">He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more drunk, he became more and more talkative.  </span><span id="en1149">The recollection of his recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face.  </span><span id="en1151">Raskolnikov listened attentively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1154">"That was five weeks ago, sir.  </span><span id="en1156">Yes....  </span><span id="en1158">As soon as Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the kingdom of Heaven.  </span><span id="en1160">It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but abuse.  </span><span id="en1162">Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children.  </span><span id="en1164">'Semyon Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh! </span><span id="en1166">' They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me!  </span><span id="en1168">They began to get real cream for me, do you hear that?  </span><span id="en1170">And how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit—eleven roubles, fifty copecks, I can't guess.  </span><span id="en1172">Boots, cotton shirt-fronts—most magnificent, a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and a half.  </span><span id="en1174">The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner—soup and salt meat with horse radish—which we had never dreamed of till then.  </span><span id="en1176">She had not any dresses...  </span><span id="en1178">none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit; and not that she'd anything to do it with, she smartened herself up with nothing at all, she'd done her hair nicely, put on a clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different person, she was younger and better looking.  </span><span id="en1180">Sonia, my little darling, had only helped with money 'for the time,' she said, 'it won't do for me to come and see you too often.  </span><span id="en1182">After dark maybe when no one can see. </span><span id="en1184">' Do you hear, do you hear?  </span><span id="en1186">I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not resist then asking her in to coffee.  </span><span id="en1188">For two hours they were sitting, whispering together.  </span><span id="en1190">'Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving a salary,' says she, 'and he went himself to his excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his study. </span><span id="en1192">' Do you hear, do you hear?  </span><span id="en1194">'To be sure,' says he, 'Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,' says he, 'and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and since moreover we've got on badly without you,' (do you hear, do you hear;) 'and so,' says he, 'I rely now on your word as a gentleman. </span><span id="en1196">' And all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she does!  </span><span id="en1198">And I don't blame her for it, no, I don't blame her!...  </span><span id="en1200">Six days ago when I brought her my first earnings in full—twenty-three roubles forty copecks altogether—she called me her poppet: 'poppet,' said she, 'my little poppet. </span><span id="en1202">' And when we were by ourselves, you understand?  </span><span id="en1204">You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a husband, would you?...  </span><span id="en1206">Well, she pinched my cheek, 'my little poppet,' said she." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1209">Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began to twitch.  </span><span id="en1211">He controlled himself however.  </span><span id="en1213">The tavern, the degraded appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered his listener.  </span><span id="en1215">Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.  </span><span id="en1217">He felt vexed that he had come here. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1220">"Honoured sir, honoured sir," cried Marmeladov recovering himself—"Oh, sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.  </span><span id="en1222">For I can feel it all....  </span><span id="en1224">And the whole of that heavenly day of my life and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to the bosom of her family....  </span><span id="en1226">And a great deal more....  </span><span id="en1228">Quite excusable, sir.  </span><span id="en1230">Well, then, sir" (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) "well, on the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night, I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look at me, all of you!  </span><span id="en1232">It's the fifth day since I left home, and they are looking for me there and it's the end of my employment, and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge.  </span><span id="en1234">I exchanged it for the garments I have on...  </span><span id="en1236">and it's the end of everything!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1239">Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table.  </span><span id="en1240">But a minute later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said: </span></p>
<p><span id="en1242">"This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!  </span><span id="en1244">He-he-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1247">"You don't say she gave it to you?"  </span><span id="en1249">cried one of the new-comers; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1252">"This very quart was bought with her money," Marmeladov declared, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en1254">Thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw....  </span><span id="en1256">She said nothing, she only looked at me without a word....  </span><span id="en1258">Not on earth, but up yonder...  </span><span id="en1260">they grieve over men, they weep, but they don't blame them, they don't blame them!  </span><span id="en1262">But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don't blame!  </span><span id="en1264">Thirty copecks yes!  </span><span id="en1266">And maybe she needs them now, eh?  </span><span id="en1268">What do you think, my dear sir?  </span><span id="en1270">For now she's got to keep up her appearance.  </span><span id="en1272">It costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know?  </span><span id="en1274">Do you understand?  </span><span id="en1276">And there's pomatum, too, you see, she must have things; petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle.  </span><span id="en1278">Do you understand, sir, do you understand what all that smartness means?  </span><span id="en1280">And here I, her own father, here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink!  </span><span id="en1282">And I am drinking it!  </span><span id="en1284">And I have already drunk it!  </span><span id="en1286">Come, who will have pity on a man like me, eh?  </span><span id="en1288">Are you sorry for me, sir, or not?  </span><span id="en1290">Tell me, sir, are you sorry or not?  </span><span id="en1292">He-he-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1295">He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left.  </span><span id="en1297">The pot was empty. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1300">"What are you to be pitied for?"  </span><span id="en1302">shouted the tavern-keeper who was again near them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1305">Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed.  </span><span id="en1307">The laughter and the oaths came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1310">"To be pitied!  </span><span id="en1312">Why am I to be pitied?"  </span><span id="en1314">Marmeladov suddenly declaimed, standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only waiting for that question. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1317">"Why am I to be pitied, you say?  </span><span id="en1319">Yes!  </span><span id="en1321">there's nothing to pity me for!  </span><span id="en1323">I ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied!  </span><span id="en1325">Crucify me, oh judge, crucify me but pity me!  </span><span id="en1327">And then I will go of myself to be crucified, for it's not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...  </span><span id="en1329">Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me?  </span><span id="en1331">It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all things, He is the One, He too is the judge.  </span><span id="en1333">He will come in that day and He will ask: 'Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross, consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another?  </span><span id="en1335">Where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father, undismayed by his beastliness? </span><span id="en1337">' And He will say, 'Come to me!  </span><span id="en1339">I have already forgiven thee once....  </span><span id="en1341">I have forgiven thee once....  </span><span id="en1343">Thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much.... </span><span id="en1345">' And he will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it...  </span><span id="en1347">I felt it in my heart when I was with her just now!  </span><span id="en1349">And He will judge and will forgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek....  </span><span id="en1351">And when He has done with all of them, then He will summon us.  </span><span id="en1353">'You too come forth,' He will say, 'Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye children of shame! </span><span id="en1355">' And we shall all come forth, without shame and shall stand before him.  </span><span id="en1357">And He will say unto us, 'Ye are swine, made in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also! </span><span id="en1359">' And the wise ones and those of understanding will say, 'Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these men? </span><span id="en1361">' And He will say, 'This is why I receive them, oh ye wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this. </span><span id="en1363">' And He will hold out His hands to us and we shall fall down before him...  </span><span id="en1365">and we shall weep...  </span><span id="en1367">and we shall understand all things!  </span><span id="en1369">Then we shall understand all!...  </span><span id="en1371">and all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even...  </span><span id="en1373">she will understand....  </span><span id="en1375">Lord, Thy kingdom come!"  </span><span id="en1377">And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought.  </span><span id="en1379">His words had created a certain impression; there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1382">"That's his notion!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1385">"Talked himself silly!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1388">"A fine clerk he is!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1391">And so on, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1394">"Let us go, sir," said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and addressing Raskolnikov—"come along with me...  </span><span id="en1396">Kozel's house, looking into the yard.  </span><span id="en1398">I'm going to Katerina Ivanovna—time I did." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1401">Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to help him.  </span><span id="en1403">Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man.  </span><span id="en1405">They had two or three hundred paces to go.  </span><span id="en1407">The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and confusion as they drew nearer the house. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1410">"It's not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now," he muttered in agitation—"and that she will begin pulling my hair.  </span><span id="en1412">What does my hair matter!  </span><span id="en1414">Bother my hair!  </span><span id="en1416">That's what I say!  </span><span id="en1418">Indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it, that's not what I am afraid of...  </span><span id="en1420">it's her eyes I am afraid of...  </span><span id="en1422">yes, her eyes...  </span><span id="en1424">the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me...  </span><span id="en1426">and her breathing too....  </span><span id="en1428">Have you noticed how people in that disease breathe...  </span><span id="en1430">when they are excited?  </span><span id="en1432">I am frightened of the children's crying, too....  </span><span id="en1434">For if Sonia has not taken them food...  </span><span id="en1436">I don't know what's happened!  </span><span id="en1438">I don't know!  </span><span id="en1440">But blows I am not afraid of....  </span><span id="en1442">Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment.  </span><span id="en1444">In fact I can't get on without it....  </span><span id="en1446">It's better so.  </span><span id="en1448">Let her strike me, it relieves her heart...  </span><span id="en1450">it's better so...  </span><span id="en1452">There is the house.  </span><span id="en1454">The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker...  </span><span id="en1456">a German, well-to-do.  </span><span id="en1458">Lead the way!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1461">They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey.  </span><span id="en1463">The staircase got darker and darker as they went up.  </span><span id="en1465">It was nearly eleven o'clock and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1468">A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar.  </span><span id="en1470">A very poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end; the whole of it was visible from the entrance.  </span><span id="en1472">It was all in disorder, littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children's garments.  </span><span id="en1474">Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet.  </span><span id="en1476">Behind it probably was the bed.  </span><span id="en1478">There was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered.  </span><span id="en1480">At the edge of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick.  </span><span id="en1482">It appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room, but their room was practically a passage.  </span><span id="en1484">The door leading to the other rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel's flat was divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter within.  </span><span id="en1486">People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there.  </span><span id="en1488">Words of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1491">Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once.  </span><span id="en1493">She was a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks.  </span><span id="en1495">She was pacing up and down in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps.  </span><span id="en1497">Her eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare.  </span><span id="en1499">And that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression.  </span><span id="en1501">She seemed to Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for Marmeladov....  </span><span id="en1503">She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.  </span><span id="en1505">She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing.  </span><span id="en1507">The room was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed.  </span><span id="en1509">From the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not close the door.  </span><span id="en1511">The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa.  </span><span id="en1513">A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a beating.  </span><span id="en1515">Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.  </span><span id="en1517">Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother's neck.  </span><span id="en1519">She was trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again.  </span><span id="en1521">At the same time her large dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face, were watching her mother with alarm.  </span><span id="en1523">Marmeladov did not enter the door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him.  </span><span id="en1525">The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for.  </span><span id="en1527">But evidently she decided that he was going into the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there.  </span><span id="en1529">Taking no further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the doorway. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1532">"Ah!"  </span><span id="en1534">she cried out in a frenzy, "he has come back!  </span><span id="en1536">The criminal!  </span><span id="en1538">the monster!...  </span><span id="en1540">And where is the money?  </span><span id="en1542">What's in your pocket, show me!  </span><span id="en1544">And your clothes are all different!  </span><span id="en1546">Where are your clothes?  </span><span id="en1548">Where is the money!  </span><span id="en1550">Speak!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1553">And she fell to searching him.  </span><span id="en1555">Marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search.  </span><span id="en1557">Not a farthing was there. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1560">"Where is the money?"  </span><span id="en1562">she cried—"Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?  </span><span id="en1564">There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!"  </span><span id="en1566">and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room.  </span><span id="en1568">Marmeladov seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1571">"And this is a consolation to me!  </span><span id="en1573">This does not hurt me, but is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir," he called out, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.  </span><span id="en1575">The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry.  </span><span id="en1577">The boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit.  </span><span id="en1579">The eldest girl was shaking like a leaf. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1582">"He's drunk it!  </span><span id="en1584">he's drunk it all," the poor woman screamed in despair—"and his clothes are gone!  </span><span id="en1586">And they are hungry, hungry!" </span><span id="en1588">—and wringing her hands she pointed to the children. " </span><span id="en1590">Oh, accursed life!  </span><span id="en1592">And you, are you not ashamed?" </span><span id="en1594">—she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov—"from the tavern!  </span><span id="en1596">Have you been drinking with him?  </span><span id="en1598">You have been drinking with him, too!  </span><span id="en1600">Go away!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1603">The young man was hastening away without uttering a word.  </span><span id="en1605">The inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it.  </span><span id="en1607">Coarse laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway.  </span><span id="en1609">Further in could be seen figures in dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of them with cards in their hands.  </span><span id="en1611">They were particularly diverted, when Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation to him.  </span><span id="en1613">They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day.  </span><span id="en1615">As he went out, Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window.  </span><span id="en1617">Afterwards on the stairs, he changed his mind and would have gone back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1620">"What a stupid thing I've done," he thought to himself, "they have Sonia and I want it myself."  </span><span id="en1622">But reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging. " </span><span id="en1624">Sonia wants pomatum too," he said as he walked along the street, and he laughed malignantly—"such smartness costs money....  </span><span id="en1626">Hm!  </span><span id="en1628">And maybe Sonia herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting big game...  </span><span id="en1630">digging for gold...  </span><span id="en1632">then they would all be without a crust to-morrow except for my money.  </span><span id="en1634">Hurrah for Sonia!  </span><span id="en1636">What a mine they've dug there!  </span><span id="en1638">And they're making the most of it!  </span><span id="en1640">Yes, they are making the most of it!  </span><span id="en1642">They've wept over it and grown used to it.  </span><span id="en1644">Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1647">He sank into thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1650">"And what if I am wrong," he cried suddenly after a moment's thought. " </span><span id="en1652">What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the whole race of mankind—then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it's all as it should be." </span></p>

<p><span id="en1656">He waked up late next day after a broken sleep.  </span><span id="en1658">But his sleep had not refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked with hatred at his room.  </span><span id="en1660">It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length.  </span><span id="en1662">It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling.  </span><span id="en1664">The furniture was in keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books; the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched.  </span><span id="en1666">A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed.  </span><span id="en1668">Often he went to sleep on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old student's overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster.  </span><span id="en1670">A little table stood in front of the sofa. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1673">It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.  </span><span id="en1675">He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation.  </span><span id="en1677">He was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing.  </span><span id="en1679">His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her, though he went without his dinner.  </span><span id="en1681">Nastasya, the cook and only servant, was rather pleased at the lodger's mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into his room with a broom.  </span><span id="en1683">She waked him up that day. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1686">"Get up, why are you asleep?"  </span><span id="en1688">she called to him. " </span><span id="en1690">It's past nine, I have brought you some tea; will you have a cup?  </span><span id="en1692">I should think you're fairly starving?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1695">Raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1698">"From the landlady, eh?"  </span><span id="en1700">he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1703">"From the landlady, indeed!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1706">She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1709">"Here, Nastasya, take it please," he said, fumbling in his pocket (for he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers—"run and buy me a loaf.  </span><span id="en1711">And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the pork-butcher's." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1714">"The loaf I'll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn't you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage?  </span><span id="en1716">It's capital soup, yesterday's.  </span><span id="en1718">I saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late.  </span><span id="en1720">It's fine soup." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1723">When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting.  </span><span id="en1725">She was a country peasant-woman and a very talkative one. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1728">"Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you," she said. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1731">He scowled. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1734">"To the police?  </span><span id="en1736">What does she want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1739">"You don't pay her money and you won't turn out of the room.  </span><span id="en1741">That's what she wants, to be sure." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1744">"The devil, that's the last straw," he muttered, grinding his teeth, "no, that would not suit me...  </span><span id="en1746">just now.  </span><span id="en1748">She is a fool," he added aloud. " </span><span id="en1750">I'll go and talk to her to-day." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1753">"Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am.  </span><span id="en1755">But why, if you are so clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it?  </span><span id="en1757">One time you used to go out, you say, to teach children.  </span><span id="en1759">But why is it you do nothing now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1762">"I am doing..."  </span><span id="en1764">Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1767">"What are you doing?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1770">"Work..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1773">"What sort of work?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1776">"I am thinking," he answered seriously after a pause. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1779">Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter.  </span><span id="en1781">She was given to laughter and when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1784">"And have you made much money by your thinking?"  </span><span id="en1786">she managed to articulate at last. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1789">"One can't go out to give lessons without boots.  </span><span id="en1791">And I'm sick of it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1794">"Don't quarrel with your bread and butter." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1797">"They pay so little for lessons.  </span><span id="en1799">What's the use of a few coppers?"  </span><span id="en1801">he answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1804">"And you want to get a fortune all at once?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1807">He looked at her strangely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1810">"Yes, I want a fortune," he answered firmly, after a brief pause. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1813">"Don't be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me!  </span><span id="en1815">Shall I get you the loaf or not?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1818">"As you please." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1821">"Ah, I forgot!  </span><span id="en1823">A letter came for you yesterday when you were out." </span></p>
<p><span id="en1826">"A letter?  </span><span id="en1828">for me!  </span><span id="en1830">from whom?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1833">"I can't say.  </span><span id="en1835">I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it.  </span><span id="en1837">Will you pay me back?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1840">"Then bring it to me, for God's sake, bring it," cried Raskolnikov greatly excited—"good God!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1843">A minute later the letter was brought him.  </span><span id="en1845">That was it: from his mother, from the province of R——.  </span><span id="en1847">He turned pale when he took it.  </span><span id="en1849">It was a long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1852">"Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness' sake; here are your three copecks, but for goodness' sake, make haste and go!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en1854">The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her presence; he wanted to be left  </span><i><span id="en1855">alone </span></i><span id="en1856">  </span><span id="en1857">with this letter.  </span><span id="en1859">When Nastasya had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.  </span><span id="en1861">He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something.  </span><span id="en1863">At last he opened it; it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting. </span></p>
<p><span id="en1867">"My dear Rodya," wrote his mother—"it's two months since I last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night, thinking.  </span><span id="en1869">But I am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence.  </span><span id="en1871">You know how I love you; you are all we have to look to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay.  </span><span id="en1873">What a grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work!  </span><span id="en1875">How could I help you out of my hundred and twenty roubles a year pension?  </span><span id="en1877">The fifteen roubles I sent you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension, from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town.  </span><span id="en1879">He is a kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father's too.  </span><span id="en1881">But having given him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done, so that I've been unable to send you anything all this time.  </span><span id="en1883">But now, thank God, I believe I shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you.  </span><span id="en1885">In the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future.  </span><span id="en1887">Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you.  </span><span id="en1889">When you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put up with in the Svidrigraïlovs' house, when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it—what could I write in answer to you?  </span><span id="en1891">If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not let your sister be insulted.  </span><span id="en1893">I was in despair myself, but what could I do?  </span><span id="en1895">And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then.  </span><span id="en1897">What made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.  </span><span id="en1899">This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year.  </span><span id="en1901">We deceived you then, writing that this money came from Dounia's savings, but that was not so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves you and what a heart she has.  </span><span id="en1903">At first indeed Mr.  </span><span id="en1905">Svidrigaïlov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table....  </span><span id="en1907">But I don't want to go into all those painful details, so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over.  </span><span id="en1909">In short, in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr.  </span><span id="en1911">Svidrigaïlov's wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time, especially when Mr.  </span><span id="en1913">Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental habits, was under the influence of Bacchus.  </span><span id="en1915">And how do you think it was all explained later on?  </span><span id="en1917">Would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt.  </span><span id="en1919">Possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.  </span><span id="en1921">And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others.  </span><span id="en1923">But at last he lost all control and had the face to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his, or even abroad.  </span><span id="en1925">You can imagine all she went through!  </span><span id="en1927">To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family.  </span><span id="en1929">And it would have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been inevitable.  </span><span id="en1931">There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks.  </span><span id="en1933">You know Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has.  </span><span id="en1935">Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness.  </span><span id="en1937">She did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were constantly in communication.  </span><span id="en1939">It all ended very unexpectedly.  </span><span id="en1941">Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all.  </span><span id="en1943">An awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant's cart, into which they flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it.  </span><span id="en1945">And a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town.  </span><span id="en1947">Only think now what answer could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and what could I have written?  </span><span id="en1949">I was in despair; I dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified and indignant, and yet what could you do?  </span><span id="en1951">You could only perhaps ruin yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not.  </span><span id="en1953">For a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about us.  </span><span id="en1955">All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch, so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave.  </span><span id="en1957">All this was set going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at her in every family.  </span><span id="en1959">She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband—which is not at all right—so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town, but over the whole surrounding district.  </span><span id="en1961">It made me ill, but Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up!  </span><span id="en1963">She is an angel!  </span><span id="en1965">But by God's mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.  </span><span id="en1967">Svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of Dounia's innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden.  </span><span id="en1969">This letter, which remained in Mr.  </span><span id="en1971">Svidrigaïlov's hands after her departure, she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating her.  </span><span id="en1973">In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl, unhappy enough already.  </span><span id="en1975">Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot read it without tears.  </span><span id="en1977">Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too, cleared Dounia's reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more than Mr.  </span><span id="en1979">Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed—as indeed is always the case with servants.  </span><span id="en1981">Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and 'again crushed' as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of Dounia's innocence.  </span><span id="en1983">The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty.  </span><span id="en1985">Then she came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to forgive her.  </span><span id="en1987">The same morning without any delay, she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in the most flattering terms Dounia's innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her behavior.  </span><span id="en1989">What was more, she showed and read to everyone the letter in Dounia's own handwriting to Mr.  </span><span id="en1991">Svidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it—which I must say I think was superfluous.  </span><span id="en1993">In this way she was busy for several days in driving about the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others.  </span><span id="en1995">And therefore they had to take turns, so that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people's.  </span><span id="en1997">In my opinion a great deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that's Marfa Petrovna's character.  </span><span id="en1999">Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia's reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly.  </span><span id="en2001">Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families, but she refused.  </span><span id="en2003">All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may say, our whole fortunes are now transformed.  </span><span id="en2005">You must know, dear Rodya, that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him.  </span><span id="en2007">I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you.  </span><span id="en2009">And you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot.  </span><span id="en2011">This was how it happened.  </span><span id="en2013">He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who has been very active in bringing the match about.  </span><span id="en2015">It began with his expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance.  </span><span id="en2017">He was properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer.  </span><span id="en2019">He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him.  </span><span id="en2021">At first, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly.  </span><span id="en2023">We thought and talked it over the whole day.  </span><span id="en2025">He is a well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune.  </span><span id="en2027">It is true that he is forty-five years old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.  </span><span id="en2029">But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.  </span><span id="en2031">And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight.  </span><span id="en2033">I give you this warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you.  </span><span id="en2035">Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards.  </span><span id="en2037">And Pyotr Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.  </span><span id="en2039">At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions 'of our most rising generation' and he is an opponent of all prejudices.  </span><span id="en2041">He said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but this is scarcely a vice.  </span><span id="en2043">I, of course, understood very little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured.  </span><span id="en2045">You know your sister's character, Rodya.  </span><span id="en2047">She is a resolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.  </span><span id="en2049">Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care.  </span><span id="en2051">Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste.  </span><span id="en2053">Besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with him.  </span><span id="en2055">And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even certain differences of opinion—which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages—Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one.  </span><span id="en2057">He struck me, for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is.  </span><span id="en2059">For instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia's consent, in the course of conversation, he declared that before making Dounia's acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor.  </span><span id="en2061">I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning.  </span><span id="en2063">And, besides, it was obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia.  </span><span id="en2065">But Dounia was vexed, and answered that 'words are not deeds,' and that, of course, is perfectly true.  </span><span id="en2067">Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2070">"I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open a legal bureau.  </span><span id="en2072">He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important case.  </span><span id="en2074">He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before the Senate.  </span><span id="en2076">So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you.  </span><span id="en2078">Oh, if only this comes to pass!  </span><span id="en2080">This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing.  </span><span id="en2082">Dounia is dreaming of nothing else.  </span><span id="en2084">We have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en2086">He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted! </span><span id="en2088">) but then he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his office.  </span><span id="en2090">The matter dropped for the time, but Dounia is thinking of nothing else now.  </span><span id="en2092">She has been in a sort of fever for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr Petrovitch's business, which might well be, seeing that you are a student of law.  </span><span id="en2094">I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of realising them.  </span><span id="en2096">And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch's evasiveness, very natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband; this she is reckoning upon.  </span><span id="en2098">Of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch, especially of your becoming his partner.  </span><span id="en2100">He is a practical man and might take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream.  </span><span id="en2102">Nor has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself, later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your own work.  </span><span id="en2104">Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree with her.  </span><span id="en2106">And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him.  </span><span id="en2108">When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance.  </span><span id="en2110">Do you know, my precious Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish, fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with them, after the wedding.  </span><span id="en2112">I am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse.  </span><span id="en2114">I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with their mothers-in-law, and I don't want to be the least bit in anyone's way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and Dounia.  </span><span id="en2116">If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter: know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years!  </span><span id="en2117">It is settled  </span><i><span id="en2118">for certain </span></i><span id="en2119">  </span><span id="en2120">that Dounia and I are to set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don't know, but very, very soon, possibly in a week.  </span><span id="en2122">It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg.  </span><span id="en2124">To suit his own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible, even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is too soon to be ready, immediately after.  </span><span id="en2126">Oh, with what happiness I shall press you to my heart!  </span><span id="en2128">Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone.  </span><span id="en2130">She is an angel!  </span><span id="en2132">She is not writing anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much, so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses.  </span><span id="en2134">But although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much money as I can in a day or two.  </span><span id="en2136">Now that everyone has heard that Dounia is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles.  </span><span id="en2138">I would send you more, but I am uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we can't be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days.  </span><span id="en2140">But we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see that the journey will not cost very much.  </span><span id="en2142">It is only ninety versts from us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel quite comfortably third class.  </span><span id="en2144">So that I may very likely be able to send to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles.  </span><span id="en2146">But enough; I have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole history, but so many events have happened!  </span><span id="en2148">And now, my precious Rodya, I embrace you and send you a mother's blessing till we meet.  </span><span id="en2150">Love Dounia your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything, more than herself.  </span><span id="en2152">She is an angel and you, Rodya, you are everything to us—our one hope, our one consolation.  </span><span id="en2154">If only you are happy, we shall be happy.  </span><span id="en2156">Do you still say your prayers, Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer?  </span><span id="en2158">I am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you.  </span><span id="en2160">Remember, dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those days.  </span><span id="en2162">Good-bye, till we meet then—I embrace you warmly, warmly, with many kisses. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2165">"Yours till death, </span></p>
<p><span id="en2167">"PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV." </span></p>
<p><span id="en2170">Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov's face was wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips.  </span><span id="en2172">He laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long time.  </span><span id="en2174">His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.  </span><span id="en2176">At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box.  </span><span id="en2178">His eyes and his mind craved for space.  </span><span id="en2180">He took up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting anyone; he had forgotten his dread.  </span><span id="en2182">He turned in the direction of the Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without noticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the astonishment of the passers-by.  </span><span id="en2184">Many of them took him to be drunk. </span></p>

<p><span id="en2188">His mother's letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief fact in it, he had felt not one moment's hesitation, even whilst he was reading the letter.  </span><span id="en2190">The essential question was settled, and irrevocably settled, in his mind: "Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr.  </span><span id="en2192">Luzhin be damned!" " </span><span id="en2194">The thing is perfectly clear," he muttered to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision. " </span><span id="en2196">No, mother, no, Dounia, you won't deceive me!  </span><span id="en2198">and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me!  </span><span id="en2200">I dare say!  </span><span id="en2202">They imagine it is arranged now and can't be broken off; but we will see whether it can or not!  </span><span id="en2204">A magnificent excuse: 'Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in post-haste, almost by express. </span><span id="en2206">' No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother's bedroom.  </span><span id="en2208">Bitter is the ascent to Golgotha....  </span><span id="en2210">Hm...  </span><span id="en2211">so it is finally settled; you have determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one who has a fortune (has  </span><i><span id="en2212">already </span></i><span id="en2213"> made his fortune, that is so much more solid and impressive) a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and who  </span><i><span id="en2214">seems </span></i><span id="en2215">  </span><span id="en2216">to be kind, as Dounia herself observes.  </span><span id="en2217">That  </span><i><span id="en2218">seems </span></i><span id="en2219">  </span><span id="en2220">beats everything!  </span><span id="en2221">And that very Dounia for that very ' </span><i><span id="en2222">seems </span></i><span id="en2224">' is marrying him!  </span><span id="en2226">Splendid!  </span><span id="en2228">splendid! </span></p>
<p><span id="en2235">"...  </span><span id="en2237">But I should like to know why mother has written to me about 'our most rising generation'?  </span><span id="en2239">Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of Mr.  </span><span id="en2241">Luzhin?  </span><span id="en2243">Oh, the cunning of them!  </span><span id="en2245">I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since?  </span><span id="en2246">Was it all put into  </span><i><span id="en2247">words </span></i><span id="en2249">, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it.  </span><span id="en2250">Most likely it was partly like that, from mother's letter it's evident: he struck her as rude  </span><i><span id="en2251">a little </span></i><span id="en2253">, and mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia.  </span><span id="en2255">And she was sure to be vexed and 'answered her angrily. </span><span id="en2257">' I should think so!  </span><span id="en2259">Who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it.  </span><span id="en2261">And why does she write to me, 'love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than herself'?  </span><span id="en2263">Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter to her son?  </span><span id="en2265">'You are our one comfort, you are everything to us. </span><span id="en2267">' Oh, mother!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2272">His bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to meet Mr.  </span><span id="en2274">Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2277">"Hm...  </span><span id="en2279">yes, that's true," he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his brain, "it is true that 'it needs time and care to get to know a man,' but there is no mistake about Mr.  </span><span id="en2281">Luzhin.  </span><span id="en2282">The chief thing is he is 'a man of business and  </span><i><span id="en2283">seems </span></i><span id="en2284">  </span><span id="en2285">kind,' that was something, wasn't it, to send the bags and big box for them!  </span><span id="en2287">A kind man, no doubt after that!  </span><span id="en2288">But his  </span><i><span id="en2289">bride </span></i><span id="en2290">  </span><span id="en2291">and her mother are to drive in a peasant's cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in it).  </span><span id="en2293">No matter!  </span><span id="en2295">It is only ninety versts and then they can 'travel very comfortably, third class,' for a thousand versts!  </span><span id="en2297">Quite right, too.  </span><span id="en2299">One must cut one's coat according to one's cloth, but what about you, Mr.  </span><span id="en2301">Luzhin?  </span><span id="en2303">She is your bride....  </span><span id="en2305">And you must be aware that her mother has to raise money on her pension for the journey.  </span><span id="en2307">To be sure it's a matter of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and expenses;—food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco.  </span><span id="en2309">The business man has got the better of them, too.  </span><span id="en2311">The luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing.  </span><span id="en2313">How is it that they don't both see all that, or is it that they don't want to see?  </span><span id="en2315">And they are pleased, pleased!  </span><span id="en2317">And to think that this is only the first blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come!  </span><span id="en2318">But what really matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the  </span><i><span id="en2319">tone </span></i><span id="en2320">  </span><span id="en2321">of the whole thing.  </span><span id="en2323">For that will be the tone after marriage, it's a foretaste of it.  </span><span id="en2325">And mother too, why should she be so lavish?  </span><span id="en2327">What will she have by the time she gets to Petersburg?  </span><span id="en2328">Three silver roubles or two 'paper ones' as  </span><i><span id="en2329">she </span></i><span id="en2330">  </span><span id="en2331">says....  </span><span id="en2333">that old woman...  </span><span id="en2335">hm.  </span><span id="en2337">What does she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards?  </span><span id="en2338">She has her reasons already for guessing that she  </span><i><span id="en2339">could not </span></i><span id="en2340">  </span><span id="en2341">live with Dounia after the marriage, even for the first few months.  </span><span id="en2343">The good man has no doubt let slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: 'I shall refuse,' says she.  </span><span id="en2345">On whom is she reckoning then?  </span><span id="en2347">Is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when Afanasy Ivanovitch's debt is paid?  </span><span id="en2349">She knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes.  </span><span id="en2351">And all her shawls don't add more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know that.  </span><span id="en2353">So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr.  </span><span id="en2355">Luzhin's generosity; 'he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me. </span><span id="en2357">' You may wait a long time for that!  </span><span id="en2359">That's how it always is with these Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture, yet they won't face the truth till they are forced to; the very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool's cap on them with his own hands.  </span><span id="en2361">I should like to know whether Mr.  </span><span id="en2363">Luzhin has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.  </span><span id="en2365">He will be sure to have it for his wedding, too!  </span><span id="en2367">Enough of him, confound him! </span></p>
<p><span id="en2375">"Well,...  </span><span id="en2377">mother I don't wonder at, it's like her, God bless her, but how could Dounia?  </span><span id="en2379">Dounia darling, as though I did not know you!  </span><span id="en2381">You were nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then.  </span><span id="en2383">Mother writes that 'Dounia can put up with a great deal. </span><span id="en2385">' I know that very well.  </span><span id="en2387">I knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that 'Dounia can put up with a great deal. </span><span id="en2389">' If she could put up with Mr.  </span><span id="en2391">Svidrigaïlov and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal.  </span><span id="en2393">And now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up with Mr.  </span><span id="en2395">Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband's bounty—who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview.  </span><span id="en2397">Granted that he 'let it slip,' though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible) but Dounia, Dounia?  </span><span id="en2399">She understands the man, of course, but she will have to live with the man.  </span><span id="en2401">Why!  </span><span id="en2403">she'd live on black bread and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein, much less Mr.  </span><span id="en2405">Luzhin's money.  </span><span id="en2407">No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew her and...  </span><span id="en2409">she is still the same, of course!  </span><span id="en2411">Yes, there's no denying, the Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill!  </span><span id="en2413">It's a bitter thing to spend one's life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has nothing in common—for her own advantage.  </span><span id="en2415">And if Mr.  </span><span id="en2417">Luzhin had been of unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to become his legal concubine.  </span><span id="en2419">Why is she consenting then?  </span><span id="en2421">What's the point of it?  </span><span id="en2423">What's the answer?  </span><span id="en2425">It's clear enough: for herself, for her comfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone else she is doing it!  </span><span id="en2427">For one she loves, for one she adores, she will sell herself!  </span><span id="en2429">That's what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her mother, she will sell herself!  </span><span id="en2431">She will sell everything!  </span><span id="en2433">In such cases, 'we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,' freedom, peace, conscience even, all, all are brought into the market.  </span><span id="en2435">Let my life go, if only my dear ones may be happy!  </span><span id="en2437">More than that, we become casuists, we learn to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can persuade ourselves that it is one's duty for a good object.  </span><span id="en2439">That's just like us, it's as clear as daylight.  </span><span id="en2441">It's clear that Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else.  </span><span id="en2443">Oh, yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him a partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his life a famous man!  </span><span id="en2445">But my mother?  </span><span id="en2447">It's all Rodya, precious Rodya, her first born!  </span><span id="en2449">For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter!  </span><span id="en2451">Oh, loving, over-partial hearts!  </span><span id="en2453">Why, for his sake we would not shrink even from Sonia's fate.  </span><span id="en2455">Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long as the world lasts.  </span><span id="en2457">Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both of you?  </span><span id="en2459">Is it right?  </span><span id="en2461">Can you bear it?  </span><span id="en2463">Is it any use?  </span><span id="en2465">Is there sense in it?  </span><span id="en2467">And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia's life is no worse than life with Mr.  </span><span id="en2469">Luzhin.  </span><span id="en2471">'There can be no question of love,' mother writes.  </span><span id="en2473">And what if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion, contempt, repulsion, what then?  </span><span id="en2475">So you will have to 'keep up your appearance,' too.  </span><span id="en2477">Is not that so?  </span><span id="en2479">Do you understand what that smartness means?  </span><span id="en2481">Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same thing as Sonia's and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case, Dounia, it's a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it's simply a question of starvation.  </span><span id="en2483">It has to be paid for, it has to be paid for, Dounia, this smartness.  </span><span id="en2485">And what if it's more than you can bear afterwards, if you regret it?  </span><span id="en2487">The bitterness, the misery, the curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa Petrovna.  </span><span id="en2489">And how will your mother feel then?  </span><span id="en2491">Even now she is uneasy, she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly?  </span><span id="en2493">And I?  </span><span id="en2495">Yes, indeed, what have you taken me for?  </span><span id="en2497">I won't have your sacrifice, Dounia, I won't have it, mother!  </span><span id="en2499">It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it shall not, it shall not!  </span><span id="en2501">I won't accept it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2504">He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2507">"It shall not be?  </span><span id="en2509">But what are you going to do to prevent it?  </span><span id="en2511">You'll forbid it?  </span><span id="en2513">And what right have you?  </span><span id="en2515">What can you promise them on your side to give you such a right?  </span><span id="en2516">Your whole life, your whole future, you will devote to them  </span><i><span id="en2517">when you have finished your studies and obtained a post </span></i><span id="en2518">? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that's all  </span><i><span id="en2519">words </span></i><span id="en2521">, but now?  </span><span id="en2523">Now something must be done, now, do you understand that?  </span><span id="en2525">And what are you doing now?  </span><span id="en2527">You are living upon them.  </span><span id="en2529">They borrow on their hundred roubles pension.  </span><span id="en2531">They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs.  </span><span id="en2533">How are you going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for them?  </span><span id="en2535">In another ten years?  </span><span id="en2537">In another ten years, mother will be blind with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too.  </span><span id="en2539">She will be worn to a shadow with fasting; and my sister?  </span><span id="en2541">Imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years?  </span><span id="en2543">What may happen to her during those ten years?  </span><span id="en2545">Can you fancy?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2550">So he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and finding a kind of enjoyment in it.  </span><span id="en2552">And yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches.  </span><span id="en2554">It was long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart.  </span><span id="en2556">Long, long ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured his heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer.  </span><span id="en2558">Now his mother's letter had burst on him like a thunderclap.  </span><span id="en2560">It was clear that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved questions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it quickly.  </span><span id="en2562">Anyway he must decide on something, or else... </span></p>
<p><span id="en2565">"Or throw up life altogether!"  </span><span id="en2567">he cried suddenly, in a frenzy—"accept one's lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2570">"Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?"  </span><span id="en2572">Marmeladov's question came suddenly into his mind, "for every man must have somewhere to turn...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en2575">He gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday, slipped back into his mind.  </span><span id="en2576">But he did not start at the thought recurring to him, for he knew, he had  </span><i><span id="en2577">felt beforehand </span></i><span id="en2579">, that it must come back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday's thought.  </span><span id="en2581">The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the thought was a mere dream: but now...  </span><span id="en2583">now it appeared not a dream at all, it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly became aware of this himself....  </span><span id="en2585">He felt a hammering in his head, and there was a darkness before his eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2589">He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something.  </span><span id="en2591">He wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K—— Boulevard.  </span><span id="en2593">There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him.  </span><span id="en2595">He walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little adventure which absorbed all his attention.  </span><span id="en2597">Looking for the seat, he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his path.  </span><span id="en2599">It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that.  </span><span id="en2601">But there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more intently.  </span><span id="en2603">He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so strange about the woman.  </span><span id="en2605">In the first place, she appeared to be a girl quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way.  </span><span id="en2607">She had on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose.  </span><span id="en2609">A little kerchief was flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side.  </span><span id="en2611">The girl was walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side.  </span><span id="en2613">She drew Raskolnikov's whole attention at last.  </span><span id="en2615">He overtook the girl at the seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner; she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes, apparently in extreme exhaustion.  </span><span id="en2617">Looking at her closely, he saw at once that she was completely drunk.  </span><span id="en2619">It was a strange and shocking sight.  </span><span id="en2621">He could hardly believe that he was not mistaken.  </span><span id="en2623">He saw before him the face of a quite young, fair-haired girl—sixteen, perhaps not more than fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking and, as it were, swollen.  </span><span id="en2625">The girl seemed hardly to know what she was doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2628">Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her, and stood facing her in perplexity.  </span><span id="en2630">This boulevard was never much frequented; and now, at two o'clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite deserted.  </span><span id="en2632">And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement.  </span><span id="en2634">He, too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his own.  </span><span id="en2636">He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way.  </span><span id="en2638">He looked angrily at him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away.  </span><span id="en2640">His intentions were unmistakable.  </span><span id="en2642">The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and moustaches.  </span><span id="en2644">Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way.  </span><span id="en2646">He left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2649">"Hey!  </span><span id="en2651">You Svidrigaïlov!  </span><span id="en2653">What do you want here?"  </span><span id="en2655">he shouted, clenching his fists and laughing, spluttering with rage. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2658">"What do you mean?"  </span><span id="en2660">the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty astonishment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2663">"Get away, that's what I mean." </span></p>
<p><span id="en2666">"How dare you, you low fellow!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2669">He raised his cane.  </span><span id="en2671">Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like himself.  </span><span id="en2673">But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a police constable stood between them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2676">"That's enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place.  </span><span id="en2678">What do you want?  </span><span id="en2680">Who are you?"  </span><span id="en2682">he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his rags. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2685">Raskolnikov looked at him intently.  </span><span id="en2687">He had a straight-forward, sensible, soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2690">"You are just the man I want," Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm. " </span><span id="en2692">I am a student, Raskolnikov....  </span><span id="en2694">You may as well know that too," he added, addressing the gentleman, "come along, I have something to show you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en2697">And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2700">"Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.  </span><span id="en2702">There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a professional.  </span><span id="en2704">It's more likely she has been given drink and deceived somewhere...  </span><span id="en2706">for the first time...  </span><span id="en2708">you understand?  </span><span id="en2710">and they've put her out into the street like that.  </span><span id="en2712">Look at the way her dress is torn, and the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man's hands; that's evident.  </span><span id="en2714">And now look there: I don't know that dandy with whom I was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she is in this state...  </span><span id="en2716">that's certain, believe me, I am not wrong.  </span><span id="en2718">I saw him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he is just waiting for me to go away.  </span><span id="en2720">Now he has walked away a little, and is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette....  </span><span id="en2722">Think how can we keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2725">The policeman saw it all in a flash.  </span><span id="en2727">The stout gentleman was easy to understand, he turned to consider the girl.  </span><span id="en2729">The policeman bent over to examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2732">"Ah, what a pity!"  </span><span id="en2734">he said, shaking his head—"why, she is quite a child!  </span><span id="en2736">She has been deceived, you can see that at once.  </span><span id="en2738">Listen, lady," he began addressing her, "where do you live?"  </span><span id="en2740">The girl opened her weary and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2743">"Here," said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty copecks, "here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address.  </span><span id="en2745">The only thing is to find out her address!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2748">"Missy, missy!"  </span><span id="en2750">the policeman began again, taking the money. " </span><span id="en2752">I'll fetch you a cab and take you home myself.  </span><span id="en2754">Where shall I take you, eh?  </span><span id="en2756">Where do you live?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2759">"Go away!  </span><span id="en2761">They won't let me alone," the girl muttered, and once more waved her hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2764">"Ach, ach, how shocking!  </span><span id="en2766">It's shameful, missy, it's a shame!"  </span><span id="en2768">He shook his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2771">"It's a difficult job," the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance.  </span><span id="en2773">He, too, must have seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money! </span></p>
<p><span id="en2776">"Did you meet her far from here?"  </span><span id="en2778">he asked him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2781">"I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in the boulevard.  </span><span id="en2783">She only just reached the seat and sank down on it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en2786">"Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have mercy on us!  </span><span id="en2788">An innocent creature like that, drunk already!  </span><span id="en2790">She has been deceived, that's a sure thing.  </span><span id="en2792">See how her dress has been torn too....  </span><span id="en2794">Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!  </span><span id="en2796">And as likely as not she belongs to gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe....  </span><span id="en2798">There are many like that nowadays.  </span><span id="en2800">She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady," and he bent over her once more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2803">Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, "looking like ladies and refined" with pretensions to gentility and smartness.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en2806">"The chief thing is," Raskolnikov persisted, "to keep her out of this scoundrel's hands!  </span><span id="en2808">Why should he outrage her!  </span><span id="en2810">It's as clear as day what he is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2813">Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him.  </span><span id="en2815">The gentleman heard him, and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and confined himself to a contemptuous look.  </span><span id="en2817">He then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2820">"Keep her out of his hands we can," said the constable thoughtfully, "if only she'd tell us where to take her, but as it is....  </span><span id="en2822">Missy, hey, missy!"  </span><span id="en2824">he bent over her once more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2827">She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she had come. " </span><span id="en2829">Oh shameful wretches, they won't let me alone!"  </span><span id="en2831">she said, waving her hand again.  </span><span id="en2833">She walked quickly, though staggering as before.  </span><span id="en2835">The dandy followed her, but along another avenue, keeping his eye on her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2838">"Don't be anxious, I won't let him have her," the policeman said resolutely, and he set off after them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2841">"Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!"  </span><span id="en2843">he repeated aloud, sighing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2846">At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2849">"Hey, here!"  </span><span id="en2851">he shouted after the policeman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2854">The latter turned round. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2857">"Let them be!  </span><span id="en2859">What is it to do with you?  </span><span id="en2861">Let her go!  </span><span id="en2863">Let him amuse himself."  </span><span id="en2865">He pointed at the dandy, "What is it to do with you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2868">The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed.  </span><span id="en2870">Raskolnikov laughed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2873">"Well!"  </span><span id="en2875">ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a madman or something even worse. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2878">"He has carried off my twenty copecks," Raskolnikov murmured angrily when he was left alone. " </span><span id="en2880">Well, let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end.  </span><span id="en2882">And why did I want to interfere?  </span><span id="en2884">Is it for me to help?  </span><span id="en2886">Have I any right to help?  </span><span id="en2888">Let them devour each other alive—what is to me?  </span><span id="en2890">How did I dare to give him twenty copecks?  </span><span id="en2892">Were they mine?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en2895">In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched.  </span><span id="en2897">He sat down on the deserted seat.  </span><span id="en2899">His thoughts strayed aimlessly....  </span><span id="en2901">He found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment.  </span><span id="en2903">He longed to forget himself altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life anew.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en2906">"Poor girl!"  </span><span id="en2908">he said, looking at the empty corner where she had sat—"She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find out....  </span><span id="en2910">She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and then maybe, turn her out of doors....  </span><span id="en2912">And even if she does not, the Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there.  </span><span id="en2914">Then there will be the hospital directly (that's always the luck of those girls with respectable mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then...  </span><span id="en2916">again the hospital...  </span><span id="en2918">drink...  </span><span id="en2920">the taverns...  </span><span id="en2922">and more hospital, in two or three years—a wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen....  </span><span id="en2924">Have not I seen cases like that?  </span><span id="en2926">And how have they been brought to it?  </span><span id="en2928">Why, they've all come to it like that.  </span><span id="en2930">Ugh!  </span><span id="en2932">But what does it matter?  </span><span id="en2934">That's as it should be, they tell us.  </span><span id="en2936">A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year go...  </span><span id="en2938">that way...  </span><span id="en2940">to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain chaste, and not be interfered with.  </span><span id="en2942">A percentage!  </span><span id="en2944">What splendid words they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory....  </span><span id="en2946">Once you've said 'percentage' there's nothing more to worry about.  </span><span id="en2948">If we had any other word...  </span><span id="en2950">maybe we might feel more uneasy....  </span><span id="en2952">But what if Dounia were one of the percentage!  </span><span id="en2954">Of another one if not that one? </span></p>
<p><span id="en2957">"But where am I going?"  </span><span id="en2959">he thought suddenly. " </span><span id="en2961">Strange, I came out for something.  </span><span id="en2963">As soon as I had read the letter I came out....  </span><span id="en2965">I was going to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin.  </span><span id="en2967">That's what it was...  </span><span id="en2969">now I remember.  </span><span id="en2971">What for, though?  </span><span id="en2973">And what put the idea of going to Razumihin into my head just now?  </span><span id="en2975">That's curious." </span></p>
<p><span id="en2978">He wondered at himself.  </span><span id="en2980">Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the university.  </span><span id="en2982">It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave him up.  </span><span id="en2984">He took no part in the students' gatherings, amusements or conversations.  </span><span id="en2986">He worked with great intensity without sparing himself, and he was respected for this, but no one liked him.  </span><span id="en2988">He was very poor, and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though he were keeping something to himself.  </span><span id="en2990">He seemed to some of his comrades to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and interests were beneath him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en2993">With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and communicative with him.  </span><span id="en2995">Indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with Razumihin.  </span><span id="en2997">He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity.  </span><span id="en2999">The better of his comrades understood this, and all were fond of him.  </span><span id="en3001">He was extremely intelligent, though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times.  </span><span id="en3003">He was of striking appearance—tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved.  </span><span id="en3005">He was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.  </span><span id="en3007">One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back.  </span><span id="en3009">There was no limit to his drinking powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.  </span><span id="en3011">Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him.  </span><span id="en3013">He could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger.  </span><span id="en3015">He was very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort or another.  </span><span id="en3017">He knew of no end of resources by which to earn money.  </span><span id="en3019">He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in the cold.  </span><span id="en3021">For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his might to save enough to return to his studies again.  </span><span id="en3023">Raskolnikov had not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even know his address.  </span><span id="en3025">About two months before, they had met in the street, but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed.  </span><span id="en3027">And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed him by, as he did not want to annoy him. </span></p>

<p><span id="en3031">"Of course, I've been meaning lately to go to Razumihin's to ask for work, to ask him to get me lessons or something..."  </span><span id="en3033">Raskolnikov thought, "but what help can he be to me now?  </span><span id="en3035">Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...  </span><span id="en3037">hm...  </span><span id="en3039">Well and what then?  </span><span id="en3041">What shall I do with the few coppers I earn?  </span><span id="en3043">That's not what I want now.  </span><span id="en3045">It's really absurd for me to go to Razumihin...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3048">The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3051">"Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of Razumihin alone?"  </span><span id="en3053">he asked himself in perplexity. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3056">He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic thought came into his head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3059">"Hm...  </span><span id="en3061">to Razumihin's," he said all at once, calmly, as though he had reached a final determination. " </span><span id="en3063">I shall go to Razumihin's of course, but...  </span><span id="en3065">not now.  </span><span id="en3067">I shall go to him...  </span><span id="en3069">on the next day after It, when It will be over and everything will begin afresh...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3072">And suddenly he realised what he was thinking. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3075">"After It," he shouted, jumping up from the seat, "but is It really going to happen?  </span><span id="en3077">Is it possible it really will happen?"  </span><span id="en3078">He left the seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards, but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing; in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all  </span><i><span id="en3079">this </span></i><span id="en3080">  </span><span id="en3081">had for a month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3085">His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold.  </span><span id="en3087">With a kind of effort he began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into brooding.  </span><span id="en3089">When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round, he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he was going.  </span><span id="en3091">In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands.  </span><span id="en3093">The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in and weighed upon him.  </span><span id="en3095">Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness, no stench.  </span><span id="en3097">But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability.  </span><span id="en3099">Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies, and children running in the gardens.  </span><span id="en3101">The flowers especially caught his attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything.  </span><span id="en3103">He was met, too, by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight.  </span><span id="en3105">Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had thirty copecks. " </span><span id="en3107">Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs yesterday," he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.  </span><span id="en3109">He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he was hungry....  </span><span id="en3111">Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort.  </span><span id="en3113">He finished eating it as he walked away.  </span><span id="en3115">It was a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once, though he only drank a wineglassful.  </span><span id="en3117">His legs felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him.  </span><span id="en3119">He turned homewards, but reaching Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3122">In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality.  </span><span id="en3124">At times monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking state.  </span><span id="en3126">Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3129">Raskolnikov had a fearful dream.  </span><span id="en3131">He dreamt he was back in his childhood in the little town of his birth.  </span><span id="en3133">He was a child about seven years old, walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday.  </span><span id="en3135">It was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it; indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in memory.  </span><span id="en3137">The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon.  </span><span id="en3139">A few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.  </span><span id="en3141">There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse, hideous hoarse singing and often fighting.  </span><span id="en3143">Drunken and horrible-looking figures were hanging about the tavern.  </span><span id="en3145">He used to cling close to his father, trembling all over when he met them.  </span><span id="en3147">Near the tavern the road became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black.  </span><span id="en3149">It was a winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the right to the graveyard.  </span><span id="en3151">In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never seen.  </span><span id="en3153">On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross.  </span><span id="en3155">He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned ikons and the old priest with the shaking head.  </span><span id="en3157">Near his grandmother's grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger brother who had died at six months old.  </span><span id="en3159">He did not remember him at all, but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave.  </span><span id="en3161">And now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he was holding his father's hand and looking with dread at the tavern.  </span><span id="en3163">A peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts, all singing and all more or less drunk.  </span><span id="en3165">Near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart, but a strange cart.  </span><span id="en3167">It was one of those big carts usually drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy goods.  </span><span id="en3169">He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going with a load than without it.  </span><span id="en3171">But now, strange to say, in the shafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants' nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut.  </span><span id="en3173">And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the window.  </span><span id="en3175">All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3178">"Get in, get in!"  </span><span id="en3180">shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot. " </span><span id="en3182">I'll take you all, get in!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3185">But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3188">"Take us all with a beast like that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3191">"Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3194">"And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3197">"Get in, I'll take you all," Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. " </span><span id="en3199">The bay has gone with Matvey," he shouted from the cart—"and this brute, mates, is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her.  </span><span id="en3201">She's just eating her head off.  </span><span id="en3203">Get in, I tell you!  </span><span id="en3205">I'll make her gallop!  </span><span id="en3207">She'll gallop!"  </span><span id="en3209">and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3212">"Get in!  </span><span id="en3214">Come along!"  </span><span id="en3216">The crowd laughed. " </span><span id="en3218">D'you hear, she'll gallop!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3221">"Gallop indeed!  </span><span id="en3223">She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3226">"She'll jog along!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3229">"Don't you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3232">"All right!  </span><span id="en3234">Give it to her!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3237">They all clambered into Mikolka's cart, laughing and making jokes.  </span><span id="en3239">Six men got in and there was still room for more.  </span><span id="en3241">They hauled in a fat, rosy-cheeked woman.  </span><span id="en3243">She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.  </span><span id="en3245">The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help laughing?  </span><span id="en3247">That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop!  </span><span id="en3249">Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help Mikolka.  </span><span id="en3251">With the cry of "now," the mare tugged with all her might, but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which were showered upon her like hail.  </span><span id="en3253">The laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3256">"Let me get in, too, mates," shouted a young man in the crowd whose appetite was aroused. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3259">"Get in, all get in," cried Mikolka, "she will draw you all.  </span><span id="en3261">I'll beat her to death!"  </span><span id="en3263">And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself with fury. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3266">"Father, father," he cried, "father, what are they doing?  </span><span id="en3268">Father, they are beating the poor horse!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3271">"Come along, come along!"  </span><span id="en3273">said his father. " </span><span id="en3275">They are drunken and foolish, they are in fun; come away, don't look!"  </span><span id="en3277">and he tried to draw him away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself with horror, ran to the horse.  </span><span id="en3279">The poor beast was in a bad way.  </span><span id="en3281">She was gasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3284">"Beat her to death," cried Mikolka, "it's come to that.  </span><span id="en3286">I'll do for her!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3289">"What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?"  </span><span id="en3291">shouted an old man in the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3294">"Did anyone ever see the like?  </span><span id="en3296">A wretched nag like that pulling such a cartload," said another. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3299">"You'll kill her," shouted the third. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3302">"Don't meddle!  </span><span id="en3304">It's my property, I'll do what I choose.  </span><span id="en3306">Get in, more of you!  </span><span id="en3308">Get in, all of you!  </span><span id="en3310">I will have her go at a gallop!..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3313">All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare, roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking.  </span><span id="en3315">Even the old man could not help smiling.  </span><span id="en3317">To think of a wretched little beast like that trying to kick! </span></p>
<p><span id="en3320">Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her about the ribs.  </span><span id="en3322">One ran each side. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3325">"Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes," cried Mikolka. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3328">"Give us a song, mates," shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling.  </span><span id="en3330">The woman went on cracking nuts and laughing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3333">...  </span><span id="en3335">He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped across the eyes, right in the eyes!  </span><span id="en3337">He was crying, he felt choking, his tears were streaming.  </span><span id="en3339">One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face, he did not feel it.  </span><span id="en3341">Wringing his hands and screaming, he rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was shaking his head in disapproval.  </span><span id="en3343">One woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare.  </span><span id="en3345">She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3348">"I'll teach you to kick," Mikolka shouted ferociously.  </span><span id="en3350">He threw down the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long, thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandished it over the mare. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3353">"He'll crush her," was shouted round him. " </span><span id="en3355">He'll kill her!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3358">"It's my property," shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow.  </span><span id="en3360">There was a sound of a heavy thud. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3363">"Thrash her, thrash her!  </span><span id="en3365">Why have you stopped?"  </span><span id="en3367">shouted voices in the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3370">And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare.  </span><span id="en3372">She sank back on her haunches, but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart.  </span><span id="en3374">But the six whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured blows.  </span><span id="en3376">Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3379">"She's a tough one," was shouted in the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3382">"She'll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her," said an admiring spectator in the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3385">"Fetch an axe to her!  </span><span id="en3387">Finish her off," shouted a third. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3390">"I'll show you!  </span><span id="en3392">Stand off," Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. " </span><span id="en3394">Look out," he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare.  </span><span id="en3396">The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull, but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3399">"Finish her off," shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of the cart.  </span><span id="en3401">Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything they could come across—whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying mare.  </span><span id="en3403">Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the crowbar.  </span><span id="en3405">The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3408">"You butchered her," someone shouted in the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3411">"Why wouldn't she gallop then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3414">"My property!"  </span><span id="en3416">shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar in his hands.  </span><span id="en3418">He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to beat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3421">"No mistake about it, you are not a Christian," many voices were shouting in the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3424">But the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips....  </span><span id="en3426">Then he jumped up and flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka.  </span><span id="en3428">At that instant his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried him out of the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3431">"Come along, come!  </span><span id="en3433">Let us go home," he said to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3436">"Father!  </span><span id="en3438">Why did they...  </span><span id="en3440">kill...  </span><span id="en3442">the poor horse!"  </span><span id="en3444">he sobbed, but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3447">"They are drunk....  </span><span id="en3449">They are brutal...  </span><span id="en3451">it's not our business!"  </span><span id="en3453">said his father.  </span><span id="en3455">He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked.  </span><span id="en3457">He tried to draw a breath, to cry out—and woke up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3460">He waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and stood up in terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3463">"Thank God, that was only a dream," he said, sitting down under a tree and drawing deep breaths. " </span><span id="en3465">But what is it?  </span><span id="en3467">Is it some fever coming on?  </span><span id="en3469">Such a hideous dream!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3472">He felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul.  </span><span id="en3474">He rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3477">"Good God!"  </span><span id="en3479">he cried, "can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an axe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open...  </span><span id="en3481">that I shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble; hide, all spattered in the blood...  </span><span id="en3483">with the axe....  </span><span id="en3485">Good God, can it be?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3488">He was shaking like a leaf as he said this. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3491">"But why am I going on like this?"  </span><span id="en3493">he continued, sitting up again, as it were in profound amazement. " </span><span id="en3495">I knew that I could never bring myself to it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now?  </span><span id="en3497">Yesterday, yesterday, when I went to make that...  </span><i><span id="en3499">experiment </span></i><span id="en3501">, yesterday I realised completely that I could never bear to do it....  </span><span id="en3503">Why am I going over it again, then?  </span><span id="en3505">Why am I hesitating?  </span><span id="en3507">As I came down the stairs yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile...  </span><span id="en3509">the very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3513">"No, I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it!  </span><span id="en3515">Granted, granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last month is clear as day, true as arithmetic....  </span><span id="en3517">My God!  </span><span id="en3519">Anyway I couldn't bring myself to it!  </span><span id="en3521">I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it!  </span><span id="en3523">Why, why then am I still...?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3526">He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge.  </span><span id="en3528">He was pale, his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly to breathe more easily.  </span><span id="en3530">He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense of relief and peace in his soul. " </span><span id="en3532">Lord," he prayed, "show me my path—I renounce that accursed...  </span><span id="en3534">dream of mine." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3537">Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky.  </span><span id="en3539">In spite of his weakness he was not conscious of fatigue.  </span><span id="en3541">It was as though an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken.  </span><span id="en3543">Freedom, freedom!  </span><span id="en3545">He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession! </span></p>
<p><span id="en3548">Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined turning-point of his fate.  </span><span id="en3550">He could never understand and explain to himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way, he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go.  </span><span id="en3552">It was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so.  </span><span id="en3554">It is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without noticing what streets he passed through.  </span><span id="en3556">But why, he was always asking himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny?  </span><span id="en3558">As though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose! </span></p>
<p><span id="en3561">It was about nine o'clock when he crossed the Hay Market.  </span><span id="en3563">At the tables and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their wares and, like their customers, were going home.  </span><span id="en3565">Rag pickers and costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market.  </span><span id="en3567">Raskolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly in the streets.  </span><span id="en3569">Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention, and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people.  </span><span id="en3571">At the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc.  </span><span id="en3573">They, too, had got up to go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just come up to them.  </span><span id="en3574">This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his  </span><i><span id="en3575">experiment </span></i><span id="en3577">....  </span><span id="en3579">He already knew all about Lizaveta and she knew him a little too.  </span><span id="en3581">She was a single woman of about thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic.  </span><span id="en3583">She was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who made her work day and night, and even beat her.  </span><span id="en3585">She was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and doubtfully.  </span><span id="en3587">They were talking of something with special warmth.  </span><span id="en3589">The moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3593">"You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna," the huckster was saying aloud. " </span><span id="en3595">Come round to-morrow about seven.  </span><span id="en3597">They will be here too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3600">"To-morrow?"  </span><span id="en3602">said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to make up her mind. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3605">"Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna," gabbled the huckster's wife, a lively little woman. " </span><span id="en3607">I look at you, you are like some little babe.  </span><span id="en3609">And she is not your own sister either—nothing but a step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3612">"But this time don't say a word to Alyona Ivanovna," her husband interrupted; "that's my advice, but come round to us without asking.  </span><span id="en3614">It will be worth your while.  </span><span id="en3616">Later on your sister herself may have a notion." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3619">"Am I to come?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3622">"About seven o'clock to-morrow.  </span><span id="en3624">And they will be here.  </span><span id="en3626">You will be able to decide for yourself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3629">"And we'll have a cup of tea," added his wife. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3632">"All right, I'll come," said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began slowly moving away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3635">Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more.  </span><span id="en3637">He passed softly, unnoticed, trying not to miss a word.  </span><span id="en3639">His first amazement was followed by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine.  </span><span id="en3640">He had learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at seven o'clock Lizaveta, the old woman's sister and only companion, would be away from home and that therefore at seven o'clock precisely the old woman  </span><i><span id="en3641">would be left alone </span></i><span id="en3642">. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3645">He was only a few steps from his lodging.  </span><span id="en3647">He went in like a man condemned to death.  </span><span id="en3649">He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking; but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3652">Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself.  </span><span id="en3654">In any case, it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone. </span></p>

<p><span id="en3658">Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his wife had invited Lizaveta.  </span><span id="en3660">It was a very ordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about it.  </span><span id="en3662">A family who had come to the town and been reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all women's things.  </span><span id="en3664">As the things would have fetched little in the market, they were looking for a dealer.  </span><span id="en3666">This was Lizaveta's business.  </span><span id="en3668">She undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it.  </span><span id="en3670">She spoke as a rule little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3673">But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late.  </span><span id="en3675">The traces of superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.  </span><span id="en3677">And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar influences and coincidences.  </span><span id="en3679">In the previous winter a student he knew called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he might want to pawn anything.  </span><span id="en3681">For a long while he did not go to her, for he had lessons and managed to get along somehow.  </span><span id="en3683">Six weeks ago he had remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his father's old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones, a present from his sister at parting.  </span><span id="en3685">He decided to take the ring.  </span><span id="en3687">When he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her.  </span><span id="en3689">He got two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home.  </span><span id="en3691">He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought.  </span><span id="en3693">A strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very much absorbed him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3696">Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer.  </span><span id="en3698">They had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea.  </span><span id="en3700">All at once he heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and give him her address.  </span><span id="en3702">This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he had just come from her and here at once he heard her name.  </span><span id="en3704">Of course it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him; the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona Ivanovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3707">"She is first-rate," he said. " </span><span id="en3709">You can always get money from her.  </span><span id="en3711">She is as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble.  </span><span id="en3713">Lots of our fellows have had dealings with her.  </span><span id="en3715">But she is an awful old harpy...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3718">And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on.  </span><span id="en3720">The student chattered on, saying that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child, though Lizaveta was at least six feet high. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3723">"There's a phenomenon for you," cried the student and he laughed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3726">They began talking about Lizaveta.  </span><span id="en3728">The student spoke about her with a peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending for him.  </span><span id="en3730">Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about her.  </span><span id="en3732">Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister, being the child of a different mother.  </span><span id="en3734">She was thirty-five.  </span><span id="en3736">She worked day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned.  </span><span id="en3738">She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind without her sister's permission.  </span><span id="en3740">The old woman had already made her will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was left to a monastery in the province of N——, that prayers might be said for her in perpetuity.  </span><span id="en3742">Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister, unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards.  </span><span id="en3744">She always wore battered goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person.  </span><span id="en3746">What the student expressed most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was continually with child. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3749">"But you say she is hideous?"  </span><span id="en3751">observed the officer. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3754">"Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but you know she is not at all hideous.  </span><span id="en3756">She has such a good-natured face and eyes.  </span><span id="en3758">Strikingly so.  </span><span id="en3760">And the proof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her.  </span><span id="en3762">She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up with anything, always willing, willing to do anything.  </span><span id="en3764">And her smile is really very sweet." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3767">"You seem to find her attractive yourself," laughed the officer. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3770">"From her queerness.  </span><span id="en3772">No, I'll tell you what.  </span><span id="en3774">I could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the faintest conscience-prick," the student added with warmth.  </span><span id="en3776">The officer laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered.  </span><span id="en3778">How strange it was! </span></p>
<p><span id="en3781">"Listen, I want to ask you a serious question," the student said hotly. " </span><span id="en3783">I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid, senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case.  </span><span id="en3785">You understand?  </span><span id="en3787">You understand?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3790">"Yes, yes, I understand," answered the officer, watching his excited companion attentively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3793">"Well, listen then.  </span><span id="en3795">On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands, on every side!  </span><span id="en3797">A hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman's money which will be buried in a monastery!  </span><span id="en3799">Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from vice, from the Lock hospitals—and all with her money.  </span><span id="en3801">Kill her, take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all.  </span><span id="en3803">What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?  </span><span id="en3805">For one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay.  </span><span id="en3807">One death, and a hundred lives in exchange—it's simple arithmetic!  </span><span id="en3809">Besides, what value has the life of that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!  </span><span id="en3811">No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact because the old woman is doing harm.  </span><span id="en3813">She is wearing out the lives of others; the other day she bit Lizaveta's finger out of spite; it almost had to be amputated." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3816">"Of course she does not deserve to live," remarked the officer, "but there it is, it's nature." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3819">"Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice.  </span><span id="en3821">But for that, there would never have been a single great man.  </span><span id="en3823">They talk of duty, conscience—I don't want to say anything against duty and conscience;—but the point is, what do we mean by them?  </span><span id="en3825">Stay, I have another question to ask you.  </span><span id="en3827">Listen!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3830">"No, you stay, I'll ask you a question.  </span><span id="en3832">Listen!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3835">"Well?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3837">"You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the old woman  </span><i><span id="en3838">yourself </span></i><span id="en3839">?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3842">"Of course not!  </span><span id="en3844">I was only arguing the justice of it....  </span><span id="en3846">It's nothing to do with me...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3849">"But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there's no justice about it....  </span><span id="en3851">Let us have another game." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3854">Raskolnikov was violently agitated.  </span><span id="en3856">Of course, it was all ordinary youthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in different forms and on different themes.  </span><span id="en3858">But why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain was just conceiving...  </span><i><span id="en3860">the very same ideas </span></i><span id="en3862">? And why, just at the moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her?  </span><span id="en3864">This coincidence always seemed strange to him.  </span><span id="en3866">This trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint.... </span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en3870">On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring.  </span><span id="en3872">Meanwhile it got dark; he had no candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up.  </span><span id="en3874">He could never recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time.  </span><span id="en3876">At last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa.  </span><span id="en3878">Soon heavy, leaden sleep came over him, as it were crushing him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3881">He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming.  </span><span id="en3883">Nastasya, coming into his room at ten o'clock the next morning, had difficulty in rousing him.  </span><span id="en3885">She brought him in tea and bread.  </span><span id="en3887">The tea was again the second brew and again in her own tea-pot. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3890">"My goodness, how he sleeps!"  </span><span id="en3892">she cried indignantly. " </span><span id="en3894">And he is always asleep." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3897">He got up with an effort.  </span><span id="en3899">His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in his garret and sank back on the sofa again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3902">"Going to sleep again," cried Nastasya. " </span><span id="en3904">Are you ill, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3907">He made no reply. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3910">"Do you want some tea?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3913">"Afterwards," he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning to the wall. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3916">Nastasya stood over him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3919">"Perhaps he really is ill," she said, turned and went out.  </span><span id="en3921">She came in again at two o'clock with soup.  </span><span id="en3923">He was lying as before.  </span><span id="en3925">The tea stood untouched.  </span><span id="en3927">Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully rousing him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3930">"Why are you lying like a log?"  </span><span id="en3932">she shouted, looking at him with repulsion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3935">He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3938">"Are you ill or not?"  </span><span id="en3940">asked Nastasya and again received no answer. " </span><span id="en3942">You'd better go out and get a breath of air," she said after a pause. " </span><span id="en3944">Will you eat it or not?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en3947">"Afterwards," he said weakly. " </span><span id="en3949">You can go." </span></p>
<p><span id="en3952">And he motioned her out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3955">She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3958">A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while at the tea and the soup.  </span><span id="en3960">Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and began to eat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en3963">He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were mechanically.  </span><span id="en3965">His head ached less.  </span><span id="en3967">After his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring, with his face in the pillow.  </span><span id="en3969">He was haunted by day-dreams and such strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis.  </span><span id="en3971">The caravan was resting, the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a complete circle; all the party were at dinner.  </span><span id="en3973">But he was drinking water from a spring which flowed gurgling close by.  </span><span id="en3975">And it was so cool, it was wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like gold....  </span><span id="en3977">Suddenly he heard a clock strike.  </span><span id="en3979">He started, roused himself, raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was, suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa.  </span><span id="en3981">He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began listening on the staircase.  </span><span id="en3983">His heart beat terribly.  </span><span id="en3985">But all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep....  </span><span id="en3987">It seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet....  </span><span id="en3989">And meanwhile perhaps it had struck six.  </span><span id="en3991">And his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted haste.  </span><span id="en3993">But the preparations to be made were few.  </span><span id="en3995">He concentrated all his energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe.  </span><span id="en3997">First he had to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat—a work of a moment.  </span><span id="en3999">He rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt.  </span><span id="en4001">From its rags he tore a long strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long.  </span><span id="en4003">He folded this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole.  </span><span id="en4005">His hands shook as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put the coat on again.  </span><span id="en4007">The needle and thread he had got ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper.  </span><span id="en4009">As for the noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended for the axe.  </span><span id="en4011">It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the street in his hands.  </span><span id="en4013">And if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable.  </span><span id="en4015">Now he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside.  </span><span id="en4017">Putting his hand in his coat pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the hand that was in the pocket.  </span><span id="en4019">This noose, too, he had designed a fortnight before. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4021">When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out the  </span><i><span id="en4022">pledge </span></i><span id="en4024">, which he had got ready long before and hidden there.  </span><span id="en4026">This pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case.  </span><span id="en4028">He picked up this piece of wood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of a workshop.  </span><span id="en4030">Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.  </span><span id="en4032">Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood, he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it.  </span><span id="en4034">This was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment.  </span><span id="en4036">The iron strip was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first minute that the "thing" was made of wood.  </span><span id="en4038">All this had been stored by him beforehand under the sofa.  </span><span id="en4040">He had only just got the pledge out when he heard someone suddenly about in the yard. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4044">"It struck six long ago." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4047">"Long ago!  </span><span id="en4049">My God!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4052">He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat.  </span><span id="en4054">He had still the most important thing to do—to steal the axe from the kitchen.  </span><span id="en4056">That the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago.  </span><span id="en4058">He had also a pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe.  </span><span id="en4060">We may note in passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in his eyes.  </span><span id="en4062">In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plans. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4065">And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all as something absurd, monstrous and impossible.  </span><span id="en4067">But a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained.  </span><span id="en4069">As for getting the axe, that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.  </span><span id="en4071">Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings; she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the door ajar.  </span><span id="en4073">It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her about.  </span><span id="en4075">And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything was over) go in and put it back again.  </span><span id="en4077">But these were doubtful points.  </span><span id="en4079">Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had come back and was on the spot.  </span><span id="en4081">He would of course have to go by and wait till she went out again.  </span><span id="en4083">But supposing she were in the meantime to miss the axe, look for it, make an outcry—that would mean suspicion or at least grounds for suspicion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4086">But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and indeed he had no time.  </span><span id="en4087">He was thinking of the chief point, and put off trifling details, until  </span><i><span id="en4088">he could believe in it all </span></i><span id="en4090">. But that seemed utterly unattainable.  </span><span id="en4092">So it seemed to himself at least.  </span><span id="en4094">He could not imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get up and simply go there....  </span><span id="en4096">Even his late experiment (i. </span><span id="en4098">e.  </span><span id="en4100">his visit with the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say "come, let us go and try it—why dream about it!" </span><span id="en4102">—and at once he had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.  </span><span id="en4104">Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he could not find rational objections in himself.  </span><span id="en4106">But in the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were forcing and drawing him to it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4110">At first—long before indeed—he had been much occupied with one question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces?  </span><span id="en4112">He had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself.  </span><span id="en4114">Almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential.  </span><span id="en4116">It was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease, developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the individual case, and then passed off like any other disease.  </span><span id="en4118">The question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4121">When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the simple reason that his design was "not a crime...."  </span><span id="en4123">We will omit all the process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have run too far ahead already....  </span><span id="en4125">We may add only that the practical, purely material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his mind. " </span><span id="en4127">One has but to keep all one's will-power and reason to deal with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business...."  </span><span id="en4129">But this preparation had never been begun.  </span><span id="en4131">His final decisions were what he came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4134">One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even left the staircase.  </span><span id="en4136">When he reached the landlady's kitchen, the door of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in Nastasya's absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe.  </span><span id="en4138">But what was his amazement when he suddenly saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line.  </span><span id="en4140">Seeing him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him all the time he was passing.  </span><span id="en4142">He turned away his eyes, and walked past as though he noticed nothing.  </span><span id="en4144">But it was the end of everything; he had not the axe!  </span><span id="en4146">He was overwhelmed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4149">"What made me think," he reflected, as he went under the gateway, "what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!  </span><span id="en4151">Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4154">He was crushed and even humiliated.  </span><span id="en4156">He could have laughed at himself in his anger....  </span><span id="en4158">A dull animal rage boiled within him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4161">He stood hesitating in the gateway.  </span><span id="en4163">To go into the street, to go a walk for appearance' sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more revolting. " </span><span id="en4165">And what a chance I have lost for ever!"  </span><span id="en4167">he muttered, standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter's little dark room, which was also open.  </span><span id="en4169">Suddenly he started.  </span><span id="en4171">From the porter's room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the right caught his eye....  </span><span id="en4173">He looked about him—nobody.  </span><span id="en4175">He approached the room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called the porter. " </span><span id="en4177">Yes, not at home!  </span><span id="en4179">Somewhere near though, in the yard, for the door is wide open."  </span><span id="en4181">He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood; at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him! " </span><span id="en4183">When reason fails, the devil helps!"  </span><span id="en4185">he thought with a strange grin.  </span><span id="en4187">This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4190">He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening suspicion.  </span><span id="en4192">He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.  </span><span id="en4194">Suddenly he thought of his hat. " </span><span id="en4196">Good heavens!  </span><span id="en4198">I had the money the day before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!"  </span><span id="en4200">A curse rose from the bottom of his soul. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4203">Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven.  </span><span id="en4205">He had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the other side.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en4208">When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid.  </span><span id="en4210">But he was not very much afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed.  </span><span id="en4212">His mind was even occupied by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long.  </span><span id="en4214">As he passed the Yusupov garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares.  </span><span id="en4216">By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town.  </span><span id="en4218">Then he was interested by the question why in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness.  </span><span id="en4220">Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. " </span><span id="en4222">What nonsense!"  </span><span id="en4224">he thought, "better think of nothing at all!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4227">"So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way," flashed through his mind, but simply flashed, like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought....  </span><span id="en4229">And by now he was near; here was the house, here was the gate.  </span><span id="en4231">Suddenly a clock somewhere struck once. " </span><span id="en4233">What!  </span><span id="en4235">can it be half-past seven?  </span><span id="en4237">Impossible, it must be fast!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4240">Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates.  </span><span id="en4242">At that very moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right.  </span><span id="en4244">On the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one noticed him and no one met him.  </span><span id="en4246">Many windows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his head—he had not the strength to.  </span><span id="en4248">The staircase leading to the old woman's room was close by, just on the right of the gateway.  </span><span id="en4250">He was already on the stairs.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en4253">Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute.  </span><span id="en4255">But the stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no one.  </span><span id="en4257">One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were at work in it, but they did not glance at him.  </span><span id="en4259">He stood still, thought a minute and went on. " </span><span id="en4261">Of course it would be better if they had not been here, but...  </span><span id="en4263">it's two storeys above them." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4266">And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the flat opposite, the empty one.  </span><span id="en4268">The flat underneath the old woman's was apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off—they had gone away!...  </span><span id="en4270">He was out of breath.  </span><span id="en4272">For one instant the thought floated through his mind "Shall I go back?"  </span><span id="en4274">But he made no answer and began listening at the old woman's door, a dead silence.  </span><span id="en4276">Then he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...  </span><span id="en4278">then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. " </span><span id="en4280">Am I very pale?"  </span><span id="en4282">he wondered. " </span><span id="en4284">Am I not evidently agitated?  </span><span id="en4286">She is mistrustful....  </span><span id="en4288">Had I better wait a little longer...  </span><span id="en4290">till my heart leaves off thumping?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4293">But his heart did not leave off.  </span><span id="en4295">On the contrary, as though to spite him, it throbbed more and more violently.  </span><span id="en4297">He could stand it no longer, he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang.  </span><span id="en4299">Half a minute later he rang again, more loudly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4302">No answer.  </span><span id="en4304">To go on ringing was useless and out of place.  </span><span id="en4306">The old woman was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone.  </span><span id="en4308">He had some knowledge of her habits...  </span><span id="en4310">and once more he put his ear to the door.  </span><span id="en4312">Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to suppose), or the sound was really very distinct.  </span><span id="en4314">Anyway, he suddenly heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the rustle of a skirt at the very door.  </span><span id="en4316">Someone was standing stealthily close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door....  </span><span id="en4318">He moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly, and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and he was almost unconscious of his body....  </span><span id="en4320">An instant later he heard the latch unfastened. </span></p>

<p><span id="en4324">The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness.  </span><span id="en4326">Then Raskolnikov lost his head and nearly made a great mistake. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4329">Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from attempting to shut it again.  </span><span id="en4331">Seeing this she did not pull the door back, but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stairs.  </span><span id="en4333">Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her.  </span><span id="en4335">She stepped back in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eyes at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4338">"Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna," he began, trying to speak easily, but his voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. " </span><span id="en4340">I have come...  </span><span id="en4342">I have brought something...  </span><span id="en4344">but we'd better come in...  </span><span id="en4346">to the light...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4349">And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited.  </span><span id="en4351">The old woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4354">"Good heavens!  </span><span id="en4356">What it is?  </span><span id="en4358">Who is it?  </span><span id="en4360">What do you want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4363">"Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me...  </span><span id="en4365">Raskolnikov...  </span><span id="en4367">here, I brought you the pledge I promised the other day..."  </span><span id="en4369">And he held out the pledge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4372">The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in the eyes of her uninvited visitor.  </span><span id="en4374">She looked intently, maliciously and mistrustfully.  </span><span id="en4376">A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything.  </span><span id="en4378">He felt that he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half minute, he thought he would have run away from her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4381">"Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?"  </span><span id="en4383">he said suddenly, also with malice. " </span><span id="en4385">Take it if you like, if not I'll go elsewhere, I am in a hurry." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4388">He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of itself.  </span><span id="en4390">The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor's resolute tone evidently restored her confidence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4393">"But why, my good sir, all of a minute....  </span><span id="en4395">What is it?"  </span><span id="en4397">she asked, looking at the pledge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4400">"The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4403">She held out her hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4406">"But how pale you are, to be sure...  </span><span id="en4408">and your hands are trembling too?  </span><span id="en4410">Have you been bathing, or what?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4413">"Fever," he answered abruptly. " </span><span id="en4415">You can't help getting pale...  </span><span id="en4417">if you've nothing to eat," he added, with difficulty articulating the words. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4420">His strength was failing him again.  </span><span id="en4422">But his answer sounded like the truth; the old woman took the pledge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4425">"What is it?"  </span><span id="en4427">she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and weighing the pledge in her hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4430">"A thing...  </span><span id="en4432">cigarette case....  </span><span id="en4434">Silver....  </span><span id="en4436">Look at it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4439">"It does not seem somehow like silver....  </span><span id="en4441">How he has wrapped it up!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4444">Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him.  </span><span id="en4446">He unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the coat.  </span><span id="en4448">His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing more numb and more wooden.  </span><span id="en4450">He was afraid he would let the axe slip and fall....  </span><span id="en4452">A sudden giddiness came over him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4455">"But what has he tied it up like this for?"  </span><span id="en4457">the old woman cried with vexation and moved towards him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4460">He had not a minute more to lose.  </span><span id="en4462">He pulled the axe quite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head.  </span><span id="en4464">He seemed not to use his own strength in this.  </span><span id="en4466">But as soon as he had once brought the axe down, his strength returned to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4469">The old woman was as always bareheaded.  </span><span id="en4471">Her thin, light hair, streaked with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat's tail and fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.  </span><span id="en4473">As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull.  </span><span id="en4475">She cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor, raising her hands to her head.  </span><span id="en4477">In one hand she still held "the pledge."  </span><span id="en4479">Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side and on the same spot.  </span><span id="en4481">The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the body fell back.  </span><span id="en4483">He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her face; she was dead.  </span><span id="en4485">Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets, the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4488">He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)—the same right-hand pocket from which she had taken the key on his last visit.  </span><span id="en4490">He was in full possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his hands were still trembling.  </span><span id="en4492">He remembered afterwards that he had been particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get smeared with blood....  </span><span id="en4494">He pulled out the keys at once, they were all, as before, in one bunch on a steel ring.  </span><span id="en4496">He ran at once into the bedroom with them.  </span><span id="en4498">It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.  </span><span id="en4500">Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt.  </span><span id="en4502">Against a third wall was a chest of drawers.  </span><span id="en4504">Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed over him.  </span><span id="en4506">He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away.  </span><span id="en4508">But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.  </span><span id="en4510">He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his mind.  </span><span id="en4512">He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her senses.  </span><span id="en4514">Leaving the keys in the chest, he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman, but did not bring it down.  </span><span id="en4516">There was no doubt that she was dead.  </span><span id="en4518">Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side.  </span><span id="en4520">He was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed it was evident without that.  </span><span id="en4522">Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of blood.  </span><span id="en4524">All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked with blood.  </span><span id="en4526">He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but something held it and prevented its coming.  </span><span id="en4528">In his impatience he raised the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood, after two minutes' hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken—it was a purse.  </span><span id="en4530">On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring.  </span><span id="en4532">The purse was stuffed very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it, flung the crosses on the old woman's body and rushed back into the bedroom, this time taking the axe with him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4535">He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them again.  </span><span id="en4537">But he was unsuccessful.  </span><span id="en4539">They would not fit in the locks.  </span><span id="en4541">It was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one and would not fit, still he tried to put it in.  </span><span id="en4543">Suddenly he remembered and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box, and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box.  </span><span id="en4545">He left the chest of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old women usually keep boxes under their beds.  </span><span id="en4547">And so it was; there was a good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails.  </span><span id="en4549">The notched key fitted at once and unlocked it.  </span><span id="en4551">At the top, under a white sheet, was a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress, then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but clothes.  </span><span id="en4553">The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on the red brocade. " </span><span id="en4555">It's red, and on red blood will be less noticeable," the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself. " </span><span id="en4557">Good God, am I going out of my senses?"  </span><span id="en4559">he thought with terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4562">But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from under the fur coat.  </span><span id="en4564">He made haste to turn them all over.  </span><span id="en4566">There turned out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes—probably all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed—bracelets, chains, ear-rings, pins and such things.  </span><span id="en4568">Some were in cases, others simply wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with tape.  </span><span id="en4570">Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he had not time to take many.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en4573">He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay.  </span><span id="en4575">He stopped short and was still as death.  </span><span id="en4577">But all was quiet, so it must have been his fancy.  </span><span id="en4579">All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though someone had uttered a low broken moan.  </span><span id="en4581">Then again dead silence for a minute or two.  </span><span id="en4583">He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited holding his breath.  </span><span id="en4585">Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4588">In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.  </span><span id="en4590">She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out.  </span><span id="en4592">Seeing him run out of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but still did not scream.  </span><span id="en4594">She began slowly backing away from him into the corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no sound, as though she could not get breath to scream.  </span><span id="en4596">He rushed at her with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies' mouths, when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them and are on the point of screaming.  </span><span id="en4598">And this hapless Lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.  </span><span id="en4600">She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding it out before her as though motioning him away.  </span><span id="en4602">The axe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the head.  </span><span id="en4604">She fell heavily at once.  </span><span id="en4606">Raskolnikov completely lost his head, snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4609">Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this second, quite unexpected murder.  </span><span id="en4611">He longed to run away from the place as fast as possible.  </span><span id="en4613">And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and, perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had done.  </span><span id="en4615">The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew stronger every minute.  </span><span id="en4617">He would not now have gone to the box or even into the room for anything in the world. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4620">But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what was of importance, and caught at trifles.  </span><span id="en4622">Glancing, however, into the kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought him of washing his hands and the axe.  </span><span id="en4624">His hands were sticky with blood.  </span><span id="en4626">He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands in the bucket.  </span><span id="en4628">When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap.  </span><span id="en4630">Then he wiped it all with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.  </span><span id="en4632">There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp.  </span><span id="en4634">He carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat.  </span><span id="en4636">Then as far as was possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat, his trousers and his boots.  </span><span id="en4638">At the first glance there seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots.  </span><span id="en4640">He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.  </span><span id="en4642">But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something quite noticeable that he was overlooking.  </span><span id="en4644">He stood in the middle of the room, lost in thought.  </span><span id="en4646">Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind—the idea that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning, of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something utterly different from what he was now doing. " </span><span id="en4648">Good God!"  </span><span id="en4650">he muttered "I must fly, fly," and he rushed into the entry.  </span><span id="en4652">But here a shock of terror awaited him such as he had never known before. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4655">He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung, was standing unfastened and at least six inches open.  </span><span id="en4657">No lock, no bolt, all the time, all that time!  </span><span id="en4659">The old woman had not shut it after him perhaps as a precaution.  </span><span id="en4661">But, good God!  </span><span id="en4663">Why, he had seen Lizaveta afterwards!  </span><span id="en4665">And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that she must have come in somehow!  </span><span id="en4667">She could not have come through the wall! </span></p>
<p><span id="en4670">He dashed to the door and fastened the latch. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4673">"But no, the wrong thing again!  </span><span id="en4675">I must get away, get away...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4678">He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the staircase. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4681">He listened a long time.  </span><span id="en4683">Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway, two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding. " </span><span id="en4685">What are they about?"  </span><span id="en4687">He waited patiently.  </span><span id="en4689">At last all was still, as though suddenly cut off; they had separated.  </span><span id="en4691">He was meaning to go out, but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone began going downstairs humming a tune. " </span><span id="en4693">How is it they all make such a noise?"  </span><span id="en4695">flashed through his mind.  </span><span id="en4697">Once more he closed the door and waited.  </span><span id="en4699">At last all was still, not a soul stirring.  </span><span id="en4701">He was just taking a step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4703">The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming  </span><i><span id="en4704">there </span></i><span id="en4706">, to the fourth floor, to the old woman.  </span><span id="en4708">Why?  </span><span id="en4710">Were the sounds somehow peculiar, significant?  </span><span id="en4712">The steps were heavy, even and unhurried.  </span><span id="en4713">Now  </span><i><span id="en4714">he </span></i><span id="en4715">  </span><span id="en4716">had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was growing more and more distinct!  </span><span id="en4718">He could hear his heavy breathing.  </span><span id="en4720">And now the third storey had been reached.  </span><span id="en4722">Coming here!  </span><span id="en4724">And it seemed to him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is rooted to the spot and cannot even move one's arms. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4729">At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him.  </span><span id="en4731">Then he took the hook and softly, noiselessly, fixed it in the catch.  </span><span id="en4733">Instinct helped him.  </span><span id="en4735">When he had done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door.  </span><span id="en4737">The unknown visitor was by now also at the door.  </span><span id="en4739">They were now standing opposite one another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when the door divided them and he was listening. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4742">The visitor panted several times. " </span><span id="en4744">He must be a big, fat man," thought Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand.  </span><span id="en4746">It seemed like a dream indeed.  </span><span id="en4748">The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4751">As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of something moving in the room.  </span><span id="en4753">For some seconds he listened quite seriously.  </span><span id="en4755">The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the handle of the door.  </span><span id="en4757">Raskolnikov gazed in horror at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out.  </span><span id="en4759">It certainly did seem possible, so violently was he shaking it.  </span><span id="en4760">He was tempted to hold the fastening, but  </span><i><span id="en4761">he </span></i><span id="en4762">  </span><span id="en4763">might be aware of it.  </span><span id="en4765">A giddiness came over him again. " </span><span id="en4767">I shall fall down!"  </span><span id="en4769">flashed through his mind, but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4773">"What's up?  </span><span id="en4775">Are they asleep or murdered?  </span><span id="en4777">D-damn them!"  </span><span id="en4779">he bawled in a thick voice, "Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch!  </span><span id="en4781">Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey, my beauty!  </span><span id="en4783">open the door!  </span><span id="en4785">Oh, damn them!  </span><span id="en4787">Are they asleep or what?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4790">And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at the bell.  </span><span id="en4792">He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate acquaintance. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4795">At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the stairs.  </span><span id="en4797">Someone else was approaching.  </span><span id="en4799">Raskolnikov had not heard them at first. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4802">"You don't say there's no one at home," the new-comer cried in a cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on pulling the bell. " </span><span id="en4804">Good evening, Koch." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4807">"From his voice he must be quite young," thought Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4810">"Who the devil can tell?  </span><span id="en4812">I've almost broken the lock," answered Koch. " </span><span id="en4814">But how do you come to know me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4817">"Why!  </span><span id="en4819">The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at billiards at Gambrinus'." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4822">"Oh!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4825">"So they are not at home?  </span><span id="en4827">That's queer.  </span><span id="en4829">It's awfully stupid though.  </span><span id="en4831">Where could the old woman have gone?  </span><span id="en4833">I've come on business." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4836">"Yes; and I have business with her, too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4839">"Well, what can we do?  </span><span id="en4841">Go back, I suppose, Aie—aie!  </span><span id="en4843">And I was hoping to get some money!"  </span><span id="en4845">cried the young man. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4848">"We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for?  </span><span id="en4850">The old witch fixed the time for me to come herself.  </span><span id="en4852">It's out of my way.  </span><span id="en4854">And where the devil she can have got to, I can't make out.  </span><span id="en4856">She sits here from year's end to year's end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4859">"Hadn't we better ask the porter?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4862">"What?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4865">"Where she's gone and when she'll be back." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4868">"Hm....  </span><span id="en4870">Damn it all!...  </span><span id="en4872">We might ask....  </span><span id="en4874">But you know she never does go anywhere." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4877">And he once more tugged at the door-handle. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4880">"Damn it all.  </span><span id="en4882">There's nothing to be done, we must go!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4885">"Stay!"  </span><span id="en4887">cried the young man suddenly. " </span><span id="en4889">Do you see how the door shakes if you pull it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4892">"Well?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4895">"That shows it's not locked, but fastened with the hook!  </span><span id="en4897">Do you hear how the hook clanks?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4900">"Well?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4903">"Why, don't you see?  </span><span id="en4905">That proves that one of them is at home.  </span><span id="en4907">If they were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside.  </span><span id="en4909">There, do you hear how the hook is clanking?  </span><span id="en4911">To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home, don't you see.  </span><span id="en4913">So there they are sitting inside and don't open the door!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4916">"Well!  </span><span id="en4918">And so they must be!"  </span><span id="en4920">cried Koch, astonished. " </span><span id="en4922">What are they about in there?"  </span><span id="en4924">And he began furiously shaking the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4927">"Stay!"  </span><span id="en4929">cried the young man again. " </span><span id="en4931">Don't pull at it!  </span><span id="en4933">There must be something wrong....  </span><span id="en4935">Here, you've been ringing and pulling at the door and still they don't open!  </span><span id="en4937">So either they've both fainted or..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4940">"What?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4943">"I tell you what.  </span><span id="en4945">Let's go fetch the porter, let him wake them up." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4948">"All right." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4951">Both were going down. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4954">"Stay.  </span><span id="en4956">You stop here while I run down for the porter." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4959">"What for?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en4962">"Well, you'd better." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4965">"All right." </span></p>
<p><span id="en4968">"I'm studying the law you see!  </span><span id="en4970">It's evident, e-vi-dent there's something wrong here!"  </span><span id="en4972">the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4975">Koch remained.  </span><span id="en4977">Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook.  </span><span id="en4979">Then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4982">Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe.  </span><span id="en4984">He was in a sort of delirium.  </span><span id="en4986">He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.  </span><span id="en4988">While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the door.  </span><span id="en4990">Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them, while they could not open the door! " </span><span id="en4992">Only make haste!"  </span><span id="en4994">was the thought that flashed through his mind. </span></p>
<p><span id="en4997">"But what the devil is he about?..."  </span><span id="en4999">Time was passing, one minute, and another—no one came.  </span><span id="en5001">Koch began to be restless. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5004">"What the devil?"  </span><span id="en5006">he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy boots on the stairs.  </span><span id="en5008">The steps died away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5011">"Good heavens!  </span><span id="en5013">What am I to do?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5016">Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door—there was no sound.  </span><span id="en5018">Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5021">He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice below—where could he go!  </span><span id="en5023">There was nowhere to hide.  </span><span id="en5025">He was just going back to the flat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5028">"Hey there!  </span><span id="en5030">Catch the brute!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5033">Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5036">"Mitka!  </span><span id="en5038">Mitka!  </span><span id="en5040">Mitka!  </span><span id="en5042">Mitka!  </span><span id="en5044">Mitka!  </span><span id="en5046">Blast him!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5049">The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was still.  </span><span id="en5051">But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stairs.  </span><span id="en5053">There were three or four of them.  </span><span id="en5055">He distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. " </span><span id="en5057">Hey!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5060">Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling "come what must!"  </span><span id="en5062">If they stopped him—all was lost; if they let him pass—all was lost too; they would remember him.  </span><span id="en5064">They were approaching; they were only a flight from him—and suddenly deliverance!  </span><span id="en5066">A few steps from him on the right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though for his benefit, they had just left.  </span><span id="en5068">It was they, no doubt, who had just run down, shouting.  </span><span id="en5070">The floor had only just been painted, in the middle of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes.  </span><span id="en5072">In one instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.  </span><span id="en5074">Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly.  </span><span id="en5076">He waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5079">No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway.  </span><span id="en5081">He passed quickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5084">He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping.  </span><span id="en5086">They would guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were going upstairs.  </span><span id="en5088">And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. " </span><span id="en5090">Should he slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street?  </span><span id="en5092">No, hopeless!  </span><span id="en5094">Should he fling away the axe?  </span><span id="en5096">Should he take a cab?  </span><span id="en5098">Hopeless, hopeless!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5101">At last he reached the turning.  </span><span id="en5103">He turned down it more dead than alive.  </span><span id="en5105">Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a grain of sand.  </span><span id="en5107">But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could scarcely move.  </span><span id="en5109">Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet. " </span><span id="en5111">My word, he has been going it!"  </span><span id="en5113">someone shouted at him when he came out on the canal bank. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5116">He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the worse it was.  </span><span id="en5118">He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back.  </span><span id="en5120">Though he was almost falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from quite a different direction. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5123">He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his house!  </span><span id="en5125">He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.  </span><span id="en5127">And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to escape observation as far as possible in doing so.  </span><span id="en5129">He was of course incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody's yard.  </span><span id="en5131">But it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter's room was closed but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at home.  </span><span id="en5133">But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he walked straight to the door and opened it.  </span><span id="en5135">If the porter had asked him, "What do you want?"  </span><span id="en5137">he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe.  </span><span id="en5139">But again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as before.  </span><span id="en5141">He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room; the landlady's door was shut.  </span><span id="en5143">When he was in his room, he flung himself on the sofa just as he was—he did not sleep, but sank into blank forgetfulness.  </span><span id="en5145">If anyone had come into his room then, he would have jumped up at once and screamed.  </span><span id="en5147">Scraps and shreds of thoughts were simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could not rest on one, in spite of all his efforts.... </span></p>

<p><span id="en5152">So he lay a very long while.  </span><span id="en5154">Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at such moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not occur to him to get up.  </span><span id="en5156">At last he noticed that it was beginning to get light.  </span><span id="en5158">He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.  </span><span id="en5160">Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he heard every night, indeed, under his window after two o'clock.  </span><span id="en5162">They woke him up now. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5165">"Ah!  </span><span id="en5167">the drunken men are coming out of the taverns," he thought, "it's past two o'clock," and at once he leaped up, as though someone had pulled him from the sofa. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5170">"What!  </span><span id="en5172">Past two o'clock!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5175">He sat down on the sofa—and instantly recollected everything!  </span><span id="en5177">All at once, in one flash, he recollected everything. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5180">For the first moment he thought he was going mad.  </span><span id="en5182">A dreadful chill came over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in his sleep.  </span><span id="en5184">Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking.  </span><span id="en5186">He opened the door and began listening—everything in the house was asleep.  </span><span id="en5188">With amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his hat off.  </span><span id="en5190">It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5193">"If anyone had come in, what would he have thought?  </span><span id="en5195">That I'm drunk but..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5198">He rushed to the window.  </span><span id="en5200">There was light enough, and he began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there no traces?  </span><span id="en5202">But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he began taking off everything and looking over again.  </span><span id="en5204">He turned everything over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through his search three times. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5207">But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers.  </span><span id="en5209">He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads.  </span><span id="en5211">There seemed to be nothing more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5214">Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of the old woman's box were still in his pockets!  </span><span id="en5216">He had not thought till then of taking them out and hiding them!  </span><span id="en5218">He had not even thought of them while he was examining his clothes!  </span><span id="en5220">What next?  </span><span id="en5222">Instantly he rushed to take them out and fling them on the table.  </span><span id="en5224">When he had pulled out everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner.  </span><span id="en5226">The paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters.  </span><span id="en5228">He began stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: "They're in!  </span><span id="en5230">All out of sight, and the purse too!"  </span><span id="en5232">he thought gleefully, getting up and gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever.  </span><span id="en5234">Suddenly he shuddered all over with horror; "My God!"  </span><span id="en5236">he whispered in despair: "what's the matter with me?  </span><span id="en5238">Is that hidden?  </span><span id="en5240">Is that the way to hide things?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5243">He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide.  </span><span id="en5245">He had only thought of money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5248">"But now, now, what am I glad of?"  </span><span id="en5250">he thought, "Is that hiding things?  </span><span id="en5252">My reason's deserting me—simply!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5255">He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another unbearable fit of shivering.  </span><span id="en5257">Mechanically he drew from a chair beside him his old student's winter coat, which was still warm though almost in rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and delirium.  </span><span id="en5259">He lost consciousness. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5262">Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time, and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5265">"How could I go to sleep again with nothing done?  </span><span id="en5267">Yes, yes; I have not taken the loop off the armhole!  </span><span id="en5269">I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!  </span><span id="en5271">Such a piece of evidence!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5274">He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits among his linen under the pillow. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5277">"Pieces of torn linen couldn't rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I think not, I think not, any way!"  </span><span id="en5279">he repeated, standing in the middle of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not forgotten anything.  </span><span id="en5281">The conviction that all his faculties, even memory, and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an insufferable torture. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5284">"Surely it isn't beginning already!  </span><span id="en5286">Surely it isn't my punishment coming upon me?  </span><span id="en5288">It is!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5291">The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them! </span></p>
<p><span id="en5294">"What is the matter with me!"  </span><span id="en5296">he cried again, like one distraught. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5299">Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces...  </span><span id="en5301">his reason was clouded....  </span><span id="en5303">Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the purse too. " </span><span id="en5305">Ah!  </span><span id="en5307">Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put the wet purse in my pocket!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5310">In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes! </span><span id="en5312">—there were traces, stains on the lining of the pocket! </span></p>
<p><span id="en5315">"So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and memory, since I guessed it of myself," he thought triumphantly, with a deep sigh of relief; "it's simply the weakness of fever, a moment's delirium," and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his trousers.  </span><span id="en5317">At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces!  </span><span id="en5319">He flung off his boots; "traces indeed!  </span><span id="en5321">The tip of the sock was soaked with blood;" he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... " </span><span id="en5323">But what am I to do with this now?  </span><span id="en5325">Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5328">He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5331">"In the stove?  </span><span id="en5333">But they would ransack the stove first of all.  </span><span id="en5335">Burn them?  </span><span id="en5337">But what can I burn them with?  </span><span id="en5339">There are no matches even.  </span><span id="en5341">No, better go out and throw it all away somewhere.  </span><span id="en5343">Yes, better throw it away," he repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, "and at once, this minute, without lingering..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5346">But his head sank on the pillow instead.  </span><span id="en5348">Again the unbearable icy shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5351">And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to "go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!"  </span><span id="en5353">Several times he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5356">He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5359">"Open, do, are you dead or alive?  </span><span id="en5361">He keeps sleeping here!"  </span><span id="en5363">shouted Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. " </span><span id="en5365">For whole days together he's snoring here like a dog!  </span><span id="en5367">A dog he is too.  </span><span id="en5369">Open I tell you.  </span><span id="en5371">It's past ten." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5374">"Maybe he's not at home," said a man's voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5377">"Ha!  </span><span id="en5379">that's the porter's voice....  </span><span id="en5381">What does he want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5384">He jumped up and sat on the sofa.  </span><span id="en5386">The beating of his heart was a positive pain. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5389">"Then who can have latched the door?"  </span><span id="en5391">retorted Nastasya. " </span><span id="en5393">He's taken to bolting himself in!  </span><span id="en5395">As if he were worth stealing!  </span><span id="en5397">Open, you stupid, wake up!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5400">"What do they want?  </span><span id="en5402">Why the porter?  </span><span id="en5404">All's discovered.  </span><span id="en5406">Resist or open?  </span><span id="en5408">Come what may!..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5411">He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5414">His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the bed.  </span><span id="en5416">Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5419">Nastasya stared at him in a strange way.  </span><span id="en5421">He glanced with a defiant and desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle-wax. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5424">"A notice from the office," he announced, as he gave him the paper. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5427">"From what office?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5430">"A summons to the police office, of course.  </span><span id="en5432">You know which office." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5435">"To the police?...  </span><span id="en5437">What for?..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5440">"How can I tell?  </span><span id="en5442">You're sent for, so you go." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5445">The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to go away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5448">"He's downright ill!"  </span><span id="en5450">observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.  </span><span id="en5452">The porter turned his head for a moment. " </span><span id="en5454">He's been in a fever since yesterday," she added. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5457">Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without opening it. " </span><span id="en5459">Don't you get up then," Nastasya went on compassionately, seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. " </span><span id="en5461">You're ill, and so don't go; there's no such hurry.  </span><span id="en5463">What have you got there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5466">He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket.  </span><span id="en5468">So he had been asleep with them in his hand.  </span><span id="en5470">Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand and so fallen asleep again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5473">"Look at the rags he's collected and sleeps with them, as though he has got hold of a treasure..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5476">And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5479">Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his eyes intently upon her.  </span><span id="en5481">Far as he was from being capable of rational reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that with a person who was going to be arrested. " </span><span id="en5483">But...  </span><span id="en5485">the police?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5488">"You'd better have some tea!  </span><span id="en5490">Yes?  </span><span id="en5492">I'll bring it, there's some left." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5495">"No...  </span><span id="en5497">I'm going; I'll go at once," he muttered, getting on to his feet. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5500">"Why, you'll never get downstairs!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5503">"Yes, I'll go." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5506">"As you please." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5509">She followed the porter out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5512">At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5515">"There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt, and rubbed and already discoloured.  </span><span id="en5517">No one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything.  </span><span id="en5519">Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed, thank God!"  </span><span id="en5521">Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood.  </span><span id="en5523">It was an ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5526">"But when has such a thing happened?  </span><span id="en5528">I never have anything to do with the police!  </span><span id="en5530">And why just to-day?"  </span><span id="en5532">he thought in agonising bewilderment. " </span><span id="en5534">Good God, only get it over soon!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5537">He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into laughter—not at the idea of prayer, but at himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5540">He began, hurriedly dressing. " </span><span id="en5542">If I'm lost, I am lost, I don't care!  </span><span id="en5544">Shall I put the sock on?"  </span><span id="en5546">he suddenly wondered, "it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5549">But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing and horror.  </span><span id="en5551">He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks, he picked it up and put it on again—and again he laughed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5554">"That's all conventional, that's all relative, merely a way of looking at it," he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his mind, while he was shuddering all over, "there, I've got it on!  </span><span id="en5556">I have finished by getting it on!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5559">But his laughter was quickly followed by despair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5562">"No, it's too much for me..."  </span><span id="en5564">he thought.  </span><span id="en5566">His legs shook. " </span><span id="en5568">From fear," he muttered.  </span><span id="en5570">His head swam and ached with fever. " </span><span id="en5572">It's a trick!  </span><span id="en5574">They want to decoy me there and confound me over everything," he mused, as he went out on to the stairs—"the worst of it is I'm almost light-headed...  </span><span id="en5576">I may blurt out something stupid..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5579">On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as they were in the hole in the wall, "and very likely, it's on purpose to search when I'm out," he thought, and stopped short.  </span><span id="en5581">But he was possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call it, that with a wave of his hand he went on. " </span><span id="en5583">Only to get it over!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5586">In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had fallen all those days.  </span><span id="en5588">Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish pedlars and half-broken-down cabs.  </span><span id="en5590">The sun shone straight in his eyes, so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going round—as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the street on a bright sunny day. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5592">When he reached the turning into  </span><i><span id="en5593">the </span></i><span id="en5594">  </span><span id="en5595">street, in an agony of trepidation he looked down it...  </span><span id="en5596">at  </span><i><span id="en5597">the </span></i><span id="en5598">  </span><span id="en5599">house...  </span><span id="en5601">and at once averted his eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5606">"If they question me, perhaps I'll simply tell," he thought, as he drew near the police-station. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5609">The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off.  </span><span id="en5611">It had lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house.  </span><span id="en5613">He had been once for a moment in the old office but long ago.  </span><span id="en5615">Turning in at the gateway, he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book in his hand. " </span><span id="en5617">A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is here," and he began ascending the stairs on the chance.  </span><span id="en5619">He did not want to ask questions of anyone. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5622">"I'll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything..."  </span><span id="en5624">he thought, as he reached the fourth floor. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5627">The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water.  </span><span id="en5629">The kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost the whole day.  </span><span id="en5631">So there was a fearful smell and heat.  </span><span id="en5633">The staircase was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes.  </span><span id="en5635">The door of the office, too, stood wide open.  </span><span id="en5637">Peasants stood waiting within.  </span><span id="en5639">There, too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5642">After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.  </span><span id="en5644">All the rooms were small and low-pitched.  </span><span id="en5646">A fearful impatience drew him on and on.  </span><span id="en5648">No one paid attention to him.  </span><span id="en5650">In the second room some clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a queer-looking set.  </span><span id="en5652">He went up to one of them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5655">"What is it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5658">He showed the notice he had received. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5661">"You are a student?"  </span><span id="en5663">the man asked, glancing at the notice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5666">"Yes, formerly a student." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5669">The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest.  </span><span id="en5671">He was a particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5674">"There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no interest in anything," thought Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5677">"Go in there to the head clerk," said the clerk, pointing towards the furthest room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5680">He went into that room—the fourth in order; it was a small room and packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.  </span><span id="en5682">Among them were two ladies.  </span><span id="en5684">One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.  </span><span id="en5686">The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face, excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.  </span><span id="en5688">Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk.  </span><span id="en5690">The latter glanced at it, said: "Wait a minute," and went on attending to the lady in mourning. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5693">He breathed more freely. " </span><span id="en5695">It can't be that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5698">By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have courage and be calm. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5701">"Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!  </span><span id="en5703">Hm...  </span><span id="en5705">it's a pity there's no air here," he added, "it's stifling....  </span><span id="en5707">It makes one's head dizzier than ever...  </span><span id="en5709">and one's mind too..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5712">He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil.  </span><span id="en5714">He was afraid of losing his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it, something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all.  </span><span id="en5716">Yet the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him and guess something from his face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5719">He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile face that looked older than his years.  </span><span id="en5721">He was fashionably dressed and foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded, and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain on his waistcoat.  </span><span id="en5723">He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who was in the room, and said them fairly correctly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5726">"Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down," he said casually to the gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5729">"Ich danke," said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank into the chair.  </span><span id="en5731">Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room.  </span><span id="en5733">She smelt of scent.  </span><span id="en5735">But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5738">The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up.  </span><span id="en5740">All at once, with some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each step.  </span><span id="en5742">He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an easy-chair.  </span><span id="en5744">The small lady positively skipped from her seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to sit down again in his presence.  </span><span id="en5746">He was the assistant superintendent.  </span><span id="en5748">He had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except a certain insolence.  </span><span id="en5750">He looked askance and rather indignantly at Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his clothes.  </span><span id="en5752">Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on him, so that he felt positively affronted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5755">"What do you want?"  </span><span id="en5757">he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5760">"I was summoned...  </span><span id="en5762">by a notice..."  </span><span id="en5764">Raskolnikov faltered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5766">"For the recovery of money due, from  </span><i><span id="en5767">the student </span></i><span id="en5769">," the head clerk interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. " </span><span id="en5771">Here!"  </span><span id="en5773">and he flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. " </span><span id="en5775">Read that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5779">"Money?  </span><span id="en5781">What money?"  </span><span id="en5783">thought Raskolnikov, "but...  </span><span id="en5785">then...  </span><span id="en5786">it's certainly not  </span><i><span id="en5787">that </span></i><span id="en5788">." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5791">And he trembled with joy.  </span><span id="en5793">He felt sudden intense indescribable relief.  </span><span id="en5795">A load was lifted from his back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5798">"And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?"  </span><span id="en5800">shouted the assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more aggrieved. " </span><span id="en5802">You are told to come at nine, and now it's twelve!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5805">"The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago," Raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder.  </span><span id="en5807">To his own surprise he, too, grew suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. " </span><span id="en5809">And it's enough that I have come here ill with fever." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5812">"Kindly refrain from shouting!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5815">"I'm not shouting, I'm speaking very quietly, it's you who are shouting at me.  </span><span id="en5817">I'm a student, and allow no one to shout at me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5820">The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he could only splutter inarticulately.  </span><span id="en5822">He leaped up from his seat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5825">"Be silent!  </span><span id="en5827">You are in a government office.  </span><span id="en5829">Don't be impudent, sir!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5832">"You're in a government office, too," cried Raskolnikov, "and you're smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect to all of us." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5835">He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5838">The head clerk looked at him with a smile.  </span><span id="en5840">The angry assistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5843">"That's not your business!"  </span><span id="en5845">he shouted at last with unnatural loudness. " </span><span id="en5847">Kindly make the declaration demanded of you.  </span><span id="en5849">Show him.  </span><span id="en5851">Alexandr Grigorievitch.  </span><span id="en5853">There is a complaint against you!  </span><span id="en5855">You don't pay your debts!  </span><span id="en5857">You're a fine bird!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5860">But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the paper, in haste to find an explanation.  </span><span id="en5862">He read it once, and a second time, and still did not understand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5865">"What is this?"  </span><span id="en5867">he asked the head clerk. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5870">"It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ.  </span><span id="en5872">You must either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your property.  </span><span id="en5874">The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed against you according to the law." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5877">"But I...  </span><span id="en5879">am not in debt to anyone!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5882">"That's not our business.  </span><span id="en5884">Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr.  </span><span id="en5886">Tchebarov.  </span><span id="en5888">We therefore summon you, hereupon." </span></p>
<p><span id="en5891">"But she is my landlady!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5894">"And what if she is your landlady?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5897">The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion, and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire for the first time—as though he would say: "Well, how do you feel now?"  </span><span id="en5899">But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery!  </span><span id="en5901">Was that worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even!  </span><span id="en5903">He stood, he read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but all mechanically.  </span><span id="en5905">The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions or surmises, without doubts and without questioning.  </span><span id="en5907">It was an instant of full, direct, purely instinctive joy.  </span><span id="en5909">But at that very moment something like a thunderstorm took place in the office.  </span><span id="en5911">The assistant superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov's disrespect, still fuming and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in with an exceedingly silly smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5914">"You shameful hussy!"  </span><span id="en5916">he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice.  </span><span id="en5918">(The lady in mourning had left the office. </span><span id="en5920">) "What was going on at your house last night?  </span><span id="en5922">Eh!  </span><span id="en5924">A disgrace again, you're a scandal to the whole street.  </span><span id="en5926">Fighting and drinking again.  </span><span id="en5928">Do you want the house of correction?  </span><span id="en5930">Why, I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the eleventh!  </span><span id="en5932">And here you are again, again, you...  </span><span id="en5934">you...!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en5937">The paper fell out of Raskolnikov's hands, and he looked wildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated.  </span><span id="en5939">But he soon saw what it meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal.  </span><span id="en5941">He listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh...  </span><span id="en5943">all his nerves were on edge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5946">"Ilya Petrovitch!"  </span><span id="en5948">the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not be stopped except by force. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5951">As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the storm.  </span><span id="en5953">But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant.  </span><span id="en5955">She moved uneasily, and curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her word: and at last she found it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en5958">"There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr.  </span><span id="en5960">Captain," she pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently, though with a strong German accent, "and no sort of scandal, and his honour came drunk, and it's the whole truth I am telling, Mr.  </span><span id="en5962">Captain, and I am not to blame....  </span><span id="en5964">Mine is an honourable house, Mr.  </span><span id="en5966">Captain, and honourable behaviour, Mr.  </span><span id="en5968">Captain, and I always, always dislike any scandal myself.  </span><span id="en5969">But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and he  </span><i><span id="en5970">ganz </span></i><span id="en5971">  </span><span id="en5972">broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said so.  </span><span id="en5974">And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it.  </span><span id="en5976">And then I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the cheek.  </span><span id="en5978">And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr.  </span><span id="en5980">Captain, and I screamed.  </span><span id="en5982">And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace.  </span><span id="en5984">The idea of squealing like a little pig at the window into the street!  </span><span id="en5986">Fie upon him!  </span><span id="en5988">And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true, Mr.  </span><span id="en5989">Captain, he tore  </span><i><span id="en5990">sein rock </span></i><span id="en5991">. And then he shouted that  </span><i><span id="en5992">man muss </span></i><span id="en5993">  </span><span id="en5994">pay him fifteen roubles damages.  </span><span id="en5996">And I did pay him, Mr.  </span><span id="en5997">Captain, five roubles for  </span><i><span id="en5998">sein rock </span></i><span id="en6000">. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused all the scandal.  </span><span id="en6002">'I will show you up,' he said, 'for I can write to all the papers about you. </span><span id="en6003">'" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6009">"Then he was an author?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6012">"Yes, Mr.  </span><span id="en6014">Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable house...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6017">"Now then!  </span><span id="en6019">Enough!  </span><span id="en6021">I have told you already..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6024">"Ilya Petrovitch!"  </span><span id="en6026">the head clerk repeated significantly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6029">The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6032">"...  </span><span id="en6034">So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it you for the last time," the assistant went on. " </span><span id="en6036">If there is a scandal in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the lock-up, as it is called in polite society.  </span><span id="en6038">Do you hear?  </span><span id="en6040">So a literary man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an 'honourable house'?  </span><span id="en6042">A nice set, these authors!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6045">And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en6047">There was a scandal the other day in a restaurant, too.  </span><span id="en6049">An author had eaten his dinner and would not pay; 'I'll write a satire on you,' says he.  </span><span id="en6051">And there was another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and daughter.  </span><span id="en6053">And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner's shop the other day.  </span><span id="en6055">They are like that, authors, literary men, students, town-criers....  </span><span id="en6057">Pfoo!  </span><span id="en6059">You get along!  </span><span id="en6061">I shall look in upon you myself one day.  </span><span id="en6063">Then you had better be careful!  </span><span id="en6065">Do you hear?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6068">With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all directions, and so curtsied herself to the door.  </span><span id="en6070">But at the door, she stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open face and splendid thick fair whiskers.  </span><span id="en6072">This was the superintendent of the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch.  </span><span id="en6074">Luise Ivanovna made haste to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she fluttered out of the office. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6077">"Again thunder and lightning—a hurricane!"  </span><span id="en6079">said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. " </span><span id="en6081">You are aroused again, you are fuming again!  </span><span id="en6083">I heard it on the stairs!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6086">"Well, what then!"  </span><span id="en6088">Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance; and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of his shoulders at each step. " </span><span id="en6090">Here, if you will kindly look: an author, or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given an I O U, won't clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest against my smoking in his presence!  </span><span id="en6092">He behaves like a cad himself, and just look at him, please.  </span><span id="en6094">Here's the gentleman, and very attractive he is!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6097">"Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder, you can't bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and went too far yourself," continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en6099">But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure you, but explosive, explosive!  </span><span id="en6101">He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no stopping him!  </span><span id="en6103">And then it's all over!  </span><span id="en6105">And at the bottom he's a heart of gold!  </span><span id="en6107">His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6110">"And what a regiment it was, too," cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified at this agreeable banter, though still sulky. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6113">Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant to them all. " </span><span id="en6115">Excuse me, Captain," he began easily, suddenly addressing Nikodim Fomitch, "will you enter into my position?...  </span><span id="en6117">I am ready to ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered.  </span><span id="en6119">I am a poor student, sick and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty.  </span><span id="en6121">I am not studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money....  </span><span id="en6123">I have a mother and sister in the province of X.  </span><span id="en6125">They will send it to me, and I will pay.  </span><span id="en6127">My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner...  </span><span id="en6129">and I don't understand this I O U at all.  </span><span id="en6131">She is asking me to pay her on this I O U.  </span><span id="en6133">How am I to pay her?  </span><span id="en6135">Judge for yourselves!..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6138">"But that is not our business, you know," the head clerk was observing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6141">"Yes, yes.  </span><span id="en6143">I perfectly agree with you.  </span><span id="en6145">But allow me to explain..."  </span><span id="en6147">Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him. " </span><span id="en6149">Allow me to explain that I have been living with her for nearly three years and at first...  </span><span id="en6151">at first...  </span><span id="en6153">for why should I not confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it was a verbal promise, freely given...  </span><span id="en6155">she was a girl...  </span><span id="en6157">indeed, I liked her, though I was not in love with her...  </span><span id="en6159">a youthful affair in fact...  </span><span id="en6161">that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those days, and I led a life of...  </span><span id="en6163">I was very heedless..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6166">"Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we've no time to waste," Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph; but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6169">"But excuse me, excuse me.  </span><span id="en6171">It is for me to explain...  </span><span id="en6173">how it all happened...  </span><span id="en6175">In my turn...  </span><span id="en6177">though I agree with you...  </span><span id="en6179">it is unnecessary.  </span><span id="en6181">But a year ago, the girl died of typhus.  </span><span id="en6183">I remained lodging there as before, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said to me...  </span><span id="en6185">and in a friendly way...  </span><span id="en6187">that she had complete trust in me, but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen roubles, all the debt I owed her.  </span><span id="en6189">She said if only I gave her that, she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never, never—those were her own words—make use of that I O U till I could pay of myself...  </span><span id="en6191">and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat, she takes action against me.  </span><span id="en6193">What am I to say to that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6196">"All these affecting details are no business of ours."  </span><span id="en6198">Ilya Petrovitch interrupted rudely. " </span><span id="en6200">You must give a written undertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6203">"Come now...  </span><span id="en6205">you are harsh," muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at the table and also beginning to write.  </span><span id="en6207">He looked a little ashamed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6210">"Write!"  </span><span id="en6212">said the head clerk to Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6215">"Write what?"  </span><span id="en6217">the latter asked, gruffly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6220">"I will dictate to you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6223">Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone's opinion, and this revulsion took place in a flash, in one instant.  </span><span id="en6225">If he had cared to think a little, he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them.  </span><span id="en6227">And where had those feelings come from?  </span><span id="en6229">Now if the whole room had been filled, not with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart.  </span><span id="en6231">A gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took conscious form in his soul.  </span><span id="en6233">It was not the meanness of his sentimental effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter's triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.  </span><span id="en6235">Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices?  </span><span id="en6237">If he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would hardly have heard the sentence to the end.  </span><span id="en6239">Something was happening to him entirely new, sudden and unknown.  </span><span id="en6241">It was not that he understood, but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers, it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life.  </span><span id="en6243">He had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation.  </span><span id="en6245">And what was most agonising—it was more a sensation than a conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the sensations he had known in his life. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6248">The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration, that he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that he would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6251">"But you can't write, you can hardly hold the pen," observed the head clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en6253">Are you ill?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6256">"Yes, I am giddy.  </span><span id="en6258">Go on!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6261">"That's all.  </span><span id="en6263">Sign it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6266">The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6269">Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away, he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands.  </span><span id="en6271">He felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull.  </span><span id="en6273">A strange idea suddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim Fomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole in the corner.  </span><span id="en6275">The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat to carry it out. " </span><span id="en6277">Hadn't I better think a minute?"  </span><span id="en6279">flashed through his mind. " </span><span id="en6281">No, better cast off the burden without thinking."  </span><span id="en6283">But all at once he stood still, rooted to the spot.  </span><span id="en6284">Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him: </span></p>
<p><span id="en6286">"It's impossible, they'll both be released.  </span><span id="en6288">To begin with, the whole story contradicts itself.  </span><span id="en6290">Why should they have called the porter, if it had been their doing?  </span><span id="en6292">To inform against themselves?  </span><span id="en6294">Or as a blind?  </span><span id="en6296">No, that would be too cunning!  </span><span id="en6298">Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in.  </span><span id="en6300">He was walking with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends.  </span><span id="en6302">Now, would he have asked his way if he had been going with such an object?  </span><span id="en6304">As for Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith's below, before he went up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight.  </span><span id="en6306">Now just consider..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6309">"But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction?  </span><span id="en6311">They state themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was unfastened." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6314">"That's just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself in; and they'd have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter too.  </span><i><span id="en6316">He </span></i><span id="en6317">  </span><span id="en6318">must have seized the interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow.  </span><span id="en6320">Koch keeps crossing himself and saying: 'If I had been there, he would have jumped out and killed me with his axe. </span><span id="en6322">' He is going to have a thanksgiving service—ha, ha!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6326">"And no one saw the murderer?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6329">"They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah's Ark," said the head clerk, who was listening. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6332">"It's clear, quite clear," Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6335">"No, it is anything but clear," Ilya Petrovitch maintained. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6338">Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did not reach it.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en6341">When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair, supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him.  </span><span id="en6343">He got up from the chair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6346">"What's this?  </span><span id="en6348">Are you ill?"  </span><span id="en6350">Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6353">"He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing," said the head clerk, settling back in his place, and taking up his work again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6356">"Have you been ill long?"  </span><span id="en6358">cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where he, too, was looking through papers.  </span><span id="en6360">He had, of course, come to look at the sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6363">"Since yesterday," muttered Raskolnikov in reply. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6366">"Did you go out yesterday?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6369">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6372">"Though you were ill?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6375">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6378">"At what time?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6381">"About seven." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6384">"And where did you go, my I ask?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6387">"Along the street." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6390">"Short and clear." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6393">Raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily, without dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch's stare. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6396">"He can scarcely stand upright.  </span><span id="en6398">And you..."  </span><span id="en6400">Nikodim Fomitch was beginning. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6403">"No matter," Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6406">Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at the head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak.  </span><span id="en6408">There was a sudden silence.  </span><span id="en6410">It was strange. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6413">"Very well, then," concluded Ilya Petrovitch, "we will not detain you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6416">Raskolnikov went out.  </span><span id="en6418">He caught the sound of eager conversation on his departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim Fomitch.  </span><span id="en6420">In the street, his faintness passed off completely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6423">"A search—there will be a search at once," he repeated to himself, hurrying home. " </span><span id="en6425">The brutes!  </span><span id="en6427">they suspect." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6430">His former terror mastered him completely again. </span></p>

<p><span id="en6434">"And what if there has been a search already?  </span><span id="en6436">What if I find them in my room?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6439">But here was his room.  </span><span id="en6441">Nothing and no one in it.  </span><span id="en6443">No one had peeped in.  </span><span id="en6445">Even Nastasya had not touched it.  </span><span id="en6447">But heavens!  </span><span id="en6449">how could he have left all those things in the hole? </span></p>
<p><span id="en6452">He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them.  </span><span id="en6454">There were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly looked to see; then four small leather cases.  </span><span id="en6456">There was a chain, too, merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked like a decoration....  </span><span id="en6458">He put them all in the different pockets of his overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal them as much as possible.  </span><span id="en6460">He took the purse, too.  </span><span id="en6462">Then he went out of his room, leaving the door open.  </span><span id="en6464">He walked quickly and resolutely, and though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him.  </span><span id="en6466">He was afraid of pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at all costs, he must hide all traces before then.  </span><span id="en6468">He must clear everything up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....  </span><span id="en6470">Where was he to go? </span></p>
<p><span id="en6473">That had long been settled: "Fling them into the canal, and all traces hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end."  </span><span id="en6475">So he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all.  </span><span id="en6477">But to get rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task.  </span><span id="en6479">He wandered along the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps' edge, and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and people were swarming everywhere.  </span><span id="en6481">Moreover he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water.  </span><span id="en6483">And what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking?  </span><span id="en6485">And of course they would.  </span><span id="en6487">Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if they had nothing to do but to watch him. " </span><span id="en6489">Why is it, or can it be my fancy?"  </span><span id="en6491">he thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6494">At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the Neva.  </span><span id="en6496">There were not so many people there, he would be less observed, and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further off.  </span><span id="en6498">He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour, worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before.  </span><span id="en6500">And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply because he had thought of it in delirium!  </span><span id="en6502">He had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was aware of it.  </span><span id="en6504">He certainly must make haste. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6507">He walked towards the Neva along V—— Prospect, but on the way another idea struck him. " </span><span id="en6509">Why to the Neva?  </span><span id="en6511">Would it not be better to go somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot perhaps?"  </span><span id="en6513">And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea seemed to him a sound one.  </span><span id="en6515">But he was not destined to go there.  </span><span id="en6517">For coming out of V—— Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard.  </span><span id="en6519">On the right hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left.  </span><span id="en6521">Here was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was lying.  </span><span id="en6523">At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed, apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding.  </span><span id="en6525">It was probably a carriage builder's or carpenter's shed; the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust.  </span><span id="en6527">Here would be the place to throw it, he thought.  </span><span id="en6529">Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, "Standing here strictly forbidden."  </span><span id="en6531">This was all the better, for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in. " </span><span id="en6533">Here I could throw it all in a heap and get away!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6536">Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds.  </span><span id="en6538">The other side of the wall was a street.  </span><span id="en6540">He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6543">He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands, and using all his strength turned it over.  </span><span id="en6545">Under the stone was a small hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.  </span><span id="en6547">The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up.  </span><span id="en6549">Then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher.  </span><span id="en6551">But he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.  </span><span id="en6553">Nothing could be noticed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6556">Then he went out, and turned into the square.  </span><span id="en6558">Again an intense, almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in the police-office. " </span><span id="en6560">I have buried my tracks!  </span><span id="en6562">And who, who can think of looking under that stone?  </span><span id="en6564">It has been lying there most likely ever since the house was built, and will lie as many years more.  </span><span id="en6566">And if it were found, who would think of me?  </span><span id="en6568">It is all over!  </span><span id="en6570">No clue!"  </span><span id="en6572">And he laughed.  </span><span id="en6574">Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square.  </span><span id="en6576">But when he reached the K—— Boulevard where two days before he had come upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased.  </span><span id="en6578">Other ideas crept into his mind.  </span><span id="en6580">He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty copecks: "Damn him!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6583">He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly.  </span><span id="en6585">All his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that point—and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6588">"Damn it all!"  </span><span id="en6590">he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury. " </span><span id="en6592">If it has begun, then it has begun.  </span><span id="en6594">Hang the new life!  </span><span id="en6596">Good Lord, how stupid it is!...  </span><span id="en6598">And what lies I told to-day!  </span><span id="en6600">How despicably I fawned upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch!  </span><span id="en6602">But that is all folly!  </span><span id="en6604">What do I care for them all, and my fawning upon them!  </span><span id="en6606">It is not that at all!  </span><span id="en6608">It is not that at all!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6611">Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6614">"If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even glance into the purse and don't know what I had there, for which I have undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base, filthy degrading business?  </span><span id="en6616">And here I wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen either...  </span><span id="en6618">how's that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6621">Yes, that was so, that was all so.  </span><span id="en6623">Yet he had known it all before, and it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though it could not possibly be otherwise....  </span><span id="en6625">Yes, he had known it all, and understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out of it....  </span><span id="en6627">Yes, so it was. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6630">"It is because I am very ill," he decided grimly at last, "I have been worrying and fretting myself, and I don't know what I am doing....  </span><span id="en6632">Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been worrying myself....  </span><span id="en6634">I shall get well and I shall not worry....  </span><span id="en6636">But what if I don't get well at all?  </span><span id="en6638">Good God, how sick I am of it all!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6641">He walked on without resting.  </span><span id="en6643">He had a terrible longing for some distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt.  </span><span id="en6645">A new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.  </span><span id="en6647">All who met him were loathsome to him—he loathed their faces, their movements, their gestures.  </span><span id="en6649">If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en6652">He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. " </span><span id="en6654">Why, he lives here, in that house," he thought, "why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord!  </span><span id="en6656">Here it's the same thing over again....  </span><span id="en6658">Very interesting to know, though; have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance?  </span><span id="en6659">Never mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the day  </span><i><span id="en6660">after </span></i><span id="en6662">; well, and so I will!  </span><span id="en6664">Besides I really cannot go further now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6668">He went up to Razumihin's room on the fifth floor. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6671">The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and he opened the door himself.  </span><span id="en6673">It was four months since they had seen each other.  </span><span id="en6675">Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed.  </span><span id="en6677">His face showed surprise. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6680">"Is it you?"  </span><span id="en6682">he cried.  </span><span id="en6684">He looked his comrade up and down; then after a brief pause, he whistled. " </span><span id="en6686">As hard up as all that!  </span><span id="en6688">Why, brother, you've cut me out!"  </span><span id="en6690">he added, looking at Raskolnikov's rags. " </span><span id="en6692">Come sit down, you are tired, I'll be bound." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6695">And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6698">"Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?"  </span><span id="en6700">He began feeling his pulse.  </span><span id="en6702">Raskolnikov pulled away his hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6705">"Never mind," he said, "I have come for this: I have no lessons....  </span><span id="en6707">I wanted,...  </span><span id="en6709">but I don't really want lessons...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6712">"But I say!  </span><span id="en6714">You are delirious, you know!"  </span><span id="en6716">Razumihin observed, watching him carefully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6719">"No, I am not." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6722">Raskolnikov got up from the sofa.  </span><span id="en6724">As he had mounted the stairs to Razumihin's, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face.  </span><span id="en6726">Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world.  </span><span id="en6728">His spleen rose within him.  </span><span id="en6730">He almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin's threshold. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6733">"Good-bye," he said abruptly, and walked to the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6736">"Stop, stop!  </span><span id="en6738">You queer fish." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6741">"I don't want to," said the other, again pulling away his hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6744">"Then why the devil have you come?  </span><span id="en6746">Are you mad, or what?  </span><span id="en6748">Why, this is...  </span><span id="en6750">almost insulting!  </span><span id="en6752">I won't let you go like that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6755">"Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could help...  </span><span id="en6757">to begin...  </span><span id="en6759">because you are kinder than anyone—cleverer, I mean, and can judge...  </span><span id="en6761">and now I see that I want nothing.  </span><span id="en6763">Do you hear?  </span><span id="en6765">Nothing at all...  </span><span id="en6767">no one's services...  </span><span id="en6769">no one's sympathy.  </span><span id="en6771">I am by myself...  </span><span id="en6773">alone.  </span><span id="en6775">Come, that's enough.  </span><span id="en6777">Leave me alone." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6780">"Stay a minute, you sweep!  </span><span id="en6782">You are a perfect madman.  </span><span id="en6784">As you like for all I care.  </span><span id="en6786">I have no lessons, do you see, and I don't care about that, but there's a bookseller, Heruvimov—and he takes the place of a lesson.  </span><span id="en6788">I would not exchange him for five lessons.  </span><span id="en6790">He's doing publishing of a kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they have!  </span><span id="en6792">The very titles are worth the money!  </span><span id="en6794">You always maintained that I was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!  </span><span id="en6796">Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of anything, but, of course, I encourage him.  </span><span id="en6798">Here are two signatures of the German text—in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, 'Is woman a human being? </span><span id="en6800">' And, of course, triumphantly proves that she is.  </span><span id="en6802">Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble.  </span><span id="en6804">It will do!  </span><span id="en6806">He pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles for the job, and I've had six already in advance.  </span><span id="en6807">When we have finished this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of  </span><i><span id="en6808">Les Confessions </span></i><span id="en6809">  </span><span id="en6810">we have marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was a kind of Radishchev.  </span><span id="en6812">You may be sure I don't contradict him, hang him!  </span><span id="en6813">Well, would you like to do the second signature of ' </span><i><span id="en6815">Is woman a human being? </span></i><span id="en6818">' If you would, take the German and pens and paper—all those are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.  </span><span id="en6820">And when you have finished the signature there will be another three roubles for you.  </span><span id="en6822">And please don't think I am doing you a service; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.  </span><span id="en6824">The only comfort is, that it's bound to be a change for the better.  </span><span id="en6826">Though who can tell, maybe it's sometimes for the worse.  </span><span id="en6828">Will you take it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6835">Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles and without a word went out.  </span><span id="en6837">Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.  </span><span id="en6839">But when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the stairs to Razumihin's again and laying on the table the German article and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6842">"Are you raving, or what?"  </span><span id="en6844">Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last. " </span><span id="en6846">What farce is this?  </span><span id="en6848">You'll drive me crazy too...  </span><span id="en6850">what did you come to see me for, damn you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6853">"I don't want...  </span><span id="en6855">translation," muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6858">"Then what the devil do you want?"  </span><span id="en6860">shouted Razumihin from above.  </span><span id="en6862">Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6865">"Hey, there!  </span><span id="en6867">Where are you living?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6870">No answer. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6873">"Well, confound you then!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6876">But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street.  </span><span id="en6878">On the Nikolaevsky Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident.  </span><span id="en6880">A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under his horses' hoofs.  </span><span id="en6882">The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic).  </span><span id="en6884">He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.  </span><span id="en6886">He heard laughter, of course. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6889">"Serves him right!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en6892">"A pickpocket I dare say." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6895">"Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on purpose; and you have to answer for him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6898">"It's a regular profession, that's what it is." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6901">But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand.  </span><span id="en6903">He looked.  </span><span id="en6905">It was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6908">"Take it, my good man, in Christ's name." </span></p>
<p><span id="en6911">He took it and they passed on.  </span><span id="en6913">It was a piece of twenty copecks.  </span><span id="en6915">From his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6918">He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace.  </span><span id="en6920">The sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the Neva.  </span><span id="en6922">The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight, and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.  </span><span id="en6924">The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely.  </span><span id="en6926">He stood still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar to him.  </span><span id="en6928">When he was attending the university, he had hundreds of times—generally on his way home—stood still on this spot, gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him.  </span><span id="en6930">It left him strangely cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless.  </span><span id="en6932">He wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting himself, put off finding the explanation of it.  </span><span id="en6934">He vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now.  </span><span id="en6936">It struck him as strange and grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before, as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...  </span><span id="en6938">so short a time ago.  </span><span id="en6940">He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his heart.  </span><span id="en6942">Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now—all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories, his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all....  </span><span id="en6944">He felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing from his sight.  </span><span id="en6946">Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist.  </span><span id="en6948">He opened his hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into the water; then he turned and went home.  </span><span id="en6950">It seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6953">Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been walking about six hours.  </span><span id="en6955">How and where he came back he did not remember.  </span><span id="en6957">Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en6960">It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream.  </span><span id="en6962">Good God, what a scream!  </span><span id="en6964">Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears, blows and curses he had never heard. </span></p>
<p><span id="en6967">He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy.  </span><span id="en6969">In terror he sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony.  </span><span id="en6971">But the fighting, wailing and cursing grew louder and louder.  </span><span id="en6973">And then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady.  </span><span id="en6975">She was howling, shrieking and wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs.  </span><span id="en6977">The voice of her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering.  </span><span id="en6979">All at once Raskolnikov trembled; he recognised the voice—it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en6981">Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady!  </span><span id="en6983">He is kicking her, banging her head against the steps—that's clear, that can be told from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds.  </span><span id="en6985">How is it, is the world topsy-turvy?  </span><span id="en6987">He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors banging. " </span><span id="en6989">But why, why, and how could it be?"  </span><span id="en6991">he repeated, thinking seriously that he had gone mad.  </span><span id="en6993">But no, he heard too distinctly!  </span><span id="en6995">And they would come to him then next, "for no doubt...  </span><span id="en6997">it's all about that...  </span><span id="en6999">about yesterday....  </span><span id="en7001">Good God!"  </span><span id="en7003">He would have fastened his door with the latch, but he could not lift his hand...  </span><span id="en7005">besides, it would be useless.  </span><span id="en7007">Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed him....  </span><span id="en7009">But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes, began gradually to subside.  </span><span id="en7011">The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses....  </span><span id="en7013">But at last he, too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. " </span><span id="en7015">Can he have gone away?  </span><span id="en7017">Good Lord!"  </span><span id="en7019">Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still weeping and moaning...  </span><span id="en7021">and then her door slammed....  </span><span id="en7023">Now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a whisper.  </span><span id="en7025">There must have been numbers of them—almost all the inmates of the block. " </span><span id="en7027">But, good God, how could it be!  </span><span id="en7029">And why, why had he come here!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7032">Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes.  </span><span id="en7034">He lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never experienced before.  </span><span id="en7036">Suddenly a bright light flashed into his room.  </span><span id="en7038">Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup.  </span><span id="en7040">Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought—bread, salt, a plate, a spoon. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7043">"You've eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant.  </span><span id="en7045">You've been trudging about all day, and you're shaking with fever." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7048">"Nastasya...  </span><span id="en7050">what were they beating the landlady for?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7053">She looked intently at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7056">"Who beat the landlady?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7059">"Just now...  </span><span id="en7061">half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant superintendent, on the stairs....  </span><span id="en7063">Why was he ill-treating her like that, and...  </span><span id="en7065">why was he here?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7068">Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a long time.  </span><span id="en7070">He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7073">"Nastasya, why don't you speak?"  </span><span id="en7075">he said timidly at last in a weak voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7078">"It's the blood," she answered at last softly, as though speaking to herself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7081">"Blood?  </span><span id="en7083">What blood?"  </span><span id="en7085">he muttered, growing white and turning towards the wall. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7088">Nastasya still looked at him without speaking. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7091">"Nobody has been beating the landlady," she declared at last in a firm, resolute voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7094">He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7097">"I heard it myself....  </span><span id="en7099">I was not asleep...  </span><span id="en7101">I was sitting up," he said still more timidly. " </span><span id="en7103">I listened a long while.  </span><span id="en7105">The assistant superintendent came....  </span><span id="en7107">Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the flats." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7110">"No one has been here.  </span><span id="en7112">That's the blood crying in your ears.  </span><span id="en7114">When there's no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying things....  </span><span id="en7116">Will you eat something?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7119">He made no answer.  </span><span id="en7121">Nastasya still stood over him, watching him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7124">"Give me something to drink...  </span><span id="en7126">Nastasya." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7129">She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.  </span><span id="en7131">He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck.  </span><span id="en7133">Then followed forgetfulness. </span></p>

<p><span id="en7137">He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.  </span><span id="en7139">He remembered a great deal afterwards.  </span><span id="en7141">Sometimes it seemed as though there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about him.  </span><span id="en7143">Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him; they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked at him.  </span><span id="en7145">He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.  </span><span id="en7147">Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times it all seemed part of the same day.  </span><span id="en7148">But of  </span><i><span id="en7149">that </span></i><span id="en7150">—of  </span><i><span id="en7151">that </span></i><span id="en7152">  </span><span id="en7153">he had no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten something he ought to remember.  </span><span id="en7155">He worried and tormented himself trying to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable terror.  </span><span id="en7157">Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and forgetfulness.  </span><span id="en7159">At last he returned to complete consciousness. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7164">It happened at ten o'clock in the morning.  </span><span id="en7166">On fine days the sun shone into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right wall and the corner near the door.  </span><span id="en7168">Nastasya was standing beside him with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him very inquisitively.  </span><span id="en7170">He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full, short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger.  </span><span id="en7172">The landlady was peeping in at the half-opened door.  </span><span id="en7174">Raskolnikov sat up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7177">"Who is this, Nastasya?"  </span><span id="en7179">he asked, pointing to the young man. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7182">"I say, he's himself again!"  </span><span id="en7184">she said. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7187">"He is himself," echoed the man. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7190">Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the door and disappeared.  </span><span id="en7192">She was always shy and dreaded conversations or discussions.  </span><span id="en7194">She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and laziness, and absurdly bashful. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7197">"Who...  </span><span id="en7199">are you?"  </span><span id="en7201">he went on, addressing the man.  </span><span id="en7203">But at that moment the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall, Razumihin came in. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7206">"What a cabin it is!"  </span><span id="en7208">he cried. " </span><span id="en7210">I am always knocking my head.  </span><span id="en7212">You call this a lodging!  </span><span id="en7214">So you are conscious, brother?  </span><span id="en7216">I've just heard the news from Pashenka." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7219">"He has just come to," said Nastasya. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7222">"Just come to," echoed the man again, with a smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7225">"And who are you?"  </span><span id="en7227">Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. " </span><span id="en7229">My name is Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend.  </span><span id="en7231">And who are you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7234">"I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and I've come on business." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7237">"Please sit down."  </span><span id="en7239">Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the table. " </span><span id="en7241">It's a good thing you've come to, brother," he went on to Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en7243">For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk anything.  </span><span id="en7245">We had to give you tea in spoonfuls.  </span><span id="en7247">I brought Zossimov to see you twice.  </span><span id="en7249">You remember Zossimov?  </span><span id="en7251">He examined you carefully and said at once it was nothing serious—something seemed to have gone to your head.  </span><span id="en7253">Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not had enough beer and radish, but it's nothing much, it will pass and you will be all right.  </span><span id="en7255">Zossimov is a first-rate fellow!  </span><span id="en7257">He is making quite a name.  </span><span id="en7259">Come, I won't keep you," he said, addressing the man again. " </span><span id="en7261">Will you explain what you want?  </span><span id="en7263">You must know, Rodya, this is the second time they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I talked to him.  </span><span id="en7265">Who was it came before?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7268">"That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please, sir.  </span><span id="en7270">That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7273">"He was more intelligent than you, don't you think so?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7276">"Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7279">"Quite so; go on." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7282">"At your mamma's request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom I presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you from our office," the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en7284">If you are in an intelligible condition, I've thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma's request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions.  </span><span id="en7286">Do you know him, sir?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7289">"Yes, I remember...  </span><span id="en7291">Vahrushin," Raskolnikov said dreamily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7294">"You hear, he knows Vahrushin," cried Razumihin. " </span><span id="en7296">He is in 'an intelligible condition'!  </span><span id="en7298">And I see you are an intelligent man too.  </span><span id="en7300">Well, it's always pleasant to hear words of wisdom." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7303">"That's the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch.  </span><span id="en7305">And at the request of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7308">"That 'hoping for better to come' is the best thing you've said, though 'your mamma' is not bad either.  </span><span id="en7310">Come then, what do you say?  </span><span id="en7312">Is he fully conscious, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7315">"That's all right.  </span><span id="en7317">If only he can sign this little paper." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7320">"He can scrawl his name.  </span><span id="en7322">Have you got the book?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7325">"Yes, here's the book." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7328">"Give it to me.  </span><span id="en7330">Here, Rodya, sit up.  </span><span id="en7332">I'll hold you.  </span><span id="en7334">Take the pen and scribble 'Raskolnikov' for him.  </span><span id="en7336">For just now, brother, money is sweeter to us than treacle." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7339">"I don't want it," said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7342">"Not want it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7345">"I won't sign it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7348">"How the devil can you do without signing it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7351">"I don't want...  </span><span id="en7353">the money." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7356">"Don't want the money!  </span><span id="en7358">Come, brother, that's nonsense, I bear witness.  </span><span id="en7360">Don't trouble, please, it's only that he is on his travels again.  </span><span id="en7362">But that's pretty common with him at all times though....  </span><span id="en7364">You are a man of judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his hand and he will sign it.  </span><span id="en7366">Here." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7369">"But I can come another time." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7372">"No, no.  </span><span id="en7374">Why should we trouble you?  </span><span id="en7376">You are a man of judgment....  </span><span id="en7378">Now, Rodya, don't keep your visitor, you see he is waiting," and he made ready to hold Raskolnikov's hand in earnest. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7381">"Stop, I'll do it alone," said the latter, taking the pen and signing his name. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7384">The messenger took out the money and went away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7387">"Bravo!  </span><span id="en7389">And now, brother, are you hungry?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7392">"Yes," answered Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7395">"Is there any soup?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7398">"Some of yesterday's," answered Nastasya, who was still standing there. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7401">"With potatoes and rice in it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7404">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7407">"I know it by heart.  </span><span id="en7409">Bring soup and give us some tea." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7412">"Very well." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7415">Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull, unreasoning terror.  </span><span id="en7417">He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what would happen. " </span><span id="en7419">I believe I am not wandering.  </span><span id="en7421">I believe it's reality," he thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7424">In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced that the tea would be ready directly.  </span><span id="en7426">With the soup she brought two spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on.  </span><span id="en7428">The table was set as it had not been for a long time.  </span><span id="en7430">The cloth was clean. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7433">"It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us up a couple of bottles of beer.  </span><span id="en7435">We could empty them." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7438">"Well, you are a cool hand," muttered Nastasya, and she departed to carry out his orders. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7441">Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention.  </span><span id="en7443">Meanwhile Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his left arm round Raskolnikov's head, although he was able to sit up, and with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that it might not burn him.  </span><span id="en7445">But the soup was only just warm.  </span><span id="en7447">Raskolnikov swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third.  </span><span id="en7449">But after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7452">Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7455">"And will you have tea?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7458">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7461">"Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on without the faculty.  </span><span id="en7463">But here is the beer!"  </span><span id="en7465">He moved back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he had not touched food for three days. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7468">"I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now," he mumbled with his mouth full of beef, "and it's all Pashenka, your dear little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me.  </span><span id="en7470">I don't ask for it, but, of course, I don't object.  </span><span id="en7472">And here's Nastasya with the tea.  </span><span id="en7474">She is a quick girl.  </span><span id="en7476">Nastasya, my dear, won't you have some beer?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7479">"Get along with your nonsense!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7482">"A cup of tea, then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7485">"A cup of tea, maybe." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7488">"Pour it out.  </span><span id="en7490">Stay, I'll pour it out myself.  </span><span id="en7492">Sit down." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7495">He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again.  </span><span id="en7497">As before, he put his left arm round the sick man's head, raised him up and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective means towards his friend's recovery.  </span><span id="en7499">Raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but even perhaps could have walked about.  </span><span id="en7501">But from some queer, almost animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.  </span><span id="en7503">Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance.  </span><span id="en7505">After sipping a dozen spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away capriciously, and sank back on the pillow.  </span><span id="en7507">There were actually real pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed that, too, and took note of it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7510">"Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some raspberry tea," said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking his soup and beer again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7513">"And where is she to get raspberries for you?"  </span><span id="en7515">asked Nastasya, balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of sugar. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7518">"She'll get it at the shop, my dear.  </span><span id="en7520">You see, Rodya, all sorts of things have been happening while you have been laid up.  </span><span id="en7522">When you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I resolved to find you out and punish you.  </span><span id="en7524">I set to work that very day.  </span><span id="en7526">How I ran about making inquiries for you!  </span><span id="en7528">This lodging of yours I had forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the Five Corners, Harlamov's house.  </span><span id="en7530">I kept trying to find that Harlamov's house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov's, but Buch's.  </span><span id="en7532">How one muddles up sound sometimes!  </span><span id="en7534">So I lost my temper, and I went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in two minutes they looked you up!  </span><span id="en7536">Your name is down there." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7539">"My name!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7542">"I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while I was there.  </span><span id="en7544">Well, it's a long story.  </span><span id="en7546">But as soon as I did land on this place, I soon got to know all your affairs—all, all, brother, I know everything; Nastasya here will tell you.  </span><span id="en7548">I made the acquaintance of Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.  </span><span id="en7550">Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office, and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7553">"He's got round her," Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7556">"Why don't you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7559">"You are a one!"  </span><span id="en7561">Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. " </span><span id="en7563">I am not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna," she added suddenly, recovering from her mirth. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7566">"I'll make a note of it.  </span><span id="en7568">Well, brother, to make a long story short, I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day.  </span><span id="en7570">I had not expected, brother, to find her so...  </span><span id="en7572">prepossessing.  </span><span id="en7574">Eh, what do you think?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7577">Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him, full of alarm. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7580">"And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect," Razumihin went on, not at all embarrassed by his silence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7583">"Ah, the sly dog!"  </span><span id="en7585">Nastasya shrieked again.  </span><span id="en7587">This conversation afforded her unspeakable delight. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7590">"It's a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way at first.  </span><span id="en7592">You ought to have approached her differently.  </span><span id="en7594">She is, so to speak, a most unaccountable character.  </span><span id="en7596">But we will talk about her character later....  </span><span id="en7598">How could you let things come to such a pass that she gave up sending you your dinner?  </span><span id="en7600">And that I O U?  </span><span id="en7602">You must have been mad to sign an I O U.  </span><span id="en7604">And that promise of marriage when her daughter, Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?...  </span><span id="en7606">I know all about it!  </span><span id="en7608">But I see that's a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me.  </span><span id="en7610">But, talking of foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think at first sight?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7613">"No," mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better to keep up the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7616">"She isn't, is she?"  </span><span id="en7618">cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out of him. " </span><span id="en7620">But she is not very clever either, eh?  </span><span id="en7622">She is essentially, essentially an unaccountable character!  </span><span id="en7624">I am sometimes quite at a loss, I assure you....  </span><span id="en7626">She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and of course she has every right to say so.  </span><span id="en7628">But I swear I judge her intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!  </span><span id="en7630">I don't understand it!  </span><span id="en7632">Well, that's all nonsense.  </span><span id="en7634">Only, seeing that you are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and that through the young lady's death she has no need to treat you as a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.  </span><span id="en7636">And she's been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7639">"It was base of me to say that....  </span><span id="en7641">My mother herself is almost a beggar...  </span><span id="en7643">and I told a lie to keep my lodging...  </span><span id="en7645">and be fed," Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7648">"Yes, you did very sensibly.  </span><span id="en7650">But the worst of it is that at that point Mr.  </span><span id="en7652">Tchebarov turns up, a business man.  </span><span id="en7654">Pashenka would never have thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the question, 'Is there any hope of realising the I O U? </span><span id="en7656">' Answer: there is, because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister, too, who would go into bondage for his sake.  </span><span id="en7658">That's what he was building upon....  </span><span id="en7660">Why do you start?  </span><span id="en7662">I know all the ins and outs of your affairs now, my dear boy—it's not for nothing that you were so open with Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as a friend....  </span><span id="en7664">But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is open; and a business man 'listens and goes on eating' you up.  </span><span id="en7666">Well, then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without hesitation he made a formal demand for payment.  </span><span id="en7668">When I heard of all this I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping the whole affair, engaging that you would pay.  </span><span id="en7670">I went security for you, brother.  </span><span id="en7672">Do you understand?  </span><span id="en7674">We called Tchebarov, flung him ten roubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of presenting it to you.  </span><span id="en7676">She trusts your word now.  </span><span id="en7678">Here, take it, you see I have torn it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7681">Razumihin put the note on the table.  </span><span id="en7683">Raskolnikov looked at him and turned to the wall without uttering a word.  </span><span id="en7685">Even Razumihin felt a twinge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7688">"I see, brother," he said a moment later, "that I have been playing the fool again.  </span><span id="en7690">I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe I have only made you cross." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7693">"Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?"  </span><span id="en7695">Raskolnikov asked, after a moment's pause without turning his head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7698">"Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought Zametov one day." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7701">"Zametov?  </span><span id="en7703">The head clerk?  </span><span id="en7705">What for?"  </span><span id="en7707">Raskolnikov turned round quickly and fixed his eyes on Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7710">"What's the matter with you?...  </span><span id="en7712">What are you upset about?  </span><span id="en7714">He wanted to make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you....  </span><span id="en7716">How could I have found out so much except from him?  </span><span id="en7718">He is a capital fellow, brother, first-rate...  </span><span id="en7720">in his own way, of course.  </span><span id="en7722">Now we are friends—see each other almost every day.  </span><span id="en7724">I have moved into this part, you know.  </span><span id="en7726">I have only just moved.  </span><span id="en7728">I've been with him to Luise Ivanovna once or twice....  </span><span id="en7730">Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna? </span></p>
<p><span id="en7733">"Did I say anything in delirium?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7736">"I should think so!  </span><span id="en7738">You were beside yourself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7741">"What did I rave about?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7744">"What next?  </span><span id="en7746">What did you rave about?  </span><span id="en7748">What people do rave about....  </span><span id="en7750">Well, brother, now I must not lose time.  </span><span id="en7752">To work."  </span><span id="en7754">He got up from the table and took up his cap. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7757">"What did I rave about?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7760">"How he keeps on!  </span><span id="en7762">Are you afraid of having let out some secret?  </span><span id="en7764">Don't worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess.  </span><span id="en7766">But you said a lot about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant superintendent.  </span><span id="en7768">And another thing that was of special interest to you was your own sock.  </span><span id="en7770">You whined, 'Give me my sock. </span><span id="en7772">' Zametov hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented, ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag.  </span><span id="en7774">And only then were you comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched thing in your hand; we could not get it from you.  </span><span id="en7776">It is most likely somewhere under your quilt at this moment.  </span><span id="en7778">And then you asked so piteously for fringe for your trousers.  </span><span id="en7780">We tried to find out what sort of fringe, but we could not make it out.  </span><span id="en7782">Now to business!  </span><span id="en7784">Here are thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account of them in an hour or two.  </span><span id="en7786">I will let Zossimov know at the same time, though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve.  </span><span id="en7788">And you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he wants a drink or anything else.  </span><span id="en7790">And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted myself.  </span><span id="en7792">Good-bye!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7795">"He calls her Pashenka!  </span><span id="en7797">Ah, he's a deep one!"  </span><span id="en7799">said Nastasya as he went out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist running downstairs after him.  </span><span id="en7801">She was very eager to hear what he would say to the landlady.  </span><span id="en7803">She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7806">No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman.  </span><span id="en7808">With burning, twitching impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to work.  </span><span id="en7810">But to what work?  </span><span id="en7812">Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7815">"Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not?  </span><span id="en7817">What if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up, and then they will come in and tell me that it's been discovered long ago and that they have only...  </span><span id="en7819">What am I to do now?  </span><span id="en7821">That's what I've forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered a minute ago." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7824">He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not what he wanted.  </span><span id="en7826">Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it, put his hand into the hole, fumbled—but that was not it.  </span><span id="en7828">He went to the stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as he had thrown them.  </span><span id="en7830">No one had looked, then!  </span><span id="en7832">Then he remembered the sock about which Razumihin had just been telling him.  </span><span id="en7834">Yes, there it lay on the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that Zametov could not have seen anything on it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7837">"Bah, Zametov!  </span><span id="en7839">The police office!  </span><span id="en7841">And why am I sent for to the police office?  </span><span id="en7843">Where's the notice?  </span><span id="en7845">Bah!  </span><span id="en7847">I am mixing it up; that was then.  </span><span id="en7849">I looked at my sock then, too, but now...  </span><span id="en7851">now I have been ill.  </span><span id="en7853">But what did Zametov come for?  </span><span id="en7855">Why did Razumihin bring him?"  </span><span id="en7857">he muttered, helplessly sitting on the sofa again. " </span><span id="en7859">What does it mean?  </span><span id="en7861">Am I still in delirium, or is it real?  </span><span id="en7863">I believe it is real....  </span><span id="en7865">Ah, I remember; I must escape!  </span><span id="en7867">Make haste to escape.  </span><span id="en7869">Yes, I must, I must escape!  </span><span id="en7871">Yes...  </span><span id="en7873">but where?  </span><span id="en7875">And where are my clothes?  </span><span id="en7877">I've no boots.  </span><span id="en7879">They've taken them away!  </span><span id="en7881">They've hidden them!  </span><span id="en7883">I understand!  </span><span id="en7885">Ah, here is my coat—they passed that over!  </span><span id="en7887">And here is money on the table, thank God!  </span><span id="en7889">And here's the I O U...  </span><span id="en7891">I'll take the money and go and take another lodging.  </span><span id="en7893">They won't find me!...  </span><span id="en7895">Yes, but the address bureau?  </span><span id="en7897">They'll find me, Razumihin will find me.  </span><span id="en7899">Better escape altogether...  </span><span id="en7901">far away...  </span><span id="en7903">to America, and let them do their worst!  </span><span id="en7905">And take the I O U...  </span><span id="en7907">it would be of use there....  </span><span id="en7909">What else shall I take?  </span><span id="en7911">They think I am ill!  </span><span id="en7913">They don't know that I can walk, ha-ha-ha!  </span><span id="en7915">I could see by their eyes that they know all about it!  </span><span id="en7917">If only I could get downstairs!  </span><span id="en7919">And what if they have set a watch there—policemen!  </span><span id="en7921">What's this tea?  </span><span id="en7923">Ah, and here is beer left, half a bottle, cold!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7926">He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.  </span><span id="en7928">But in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran down his spine.  </span><span id="en7930">He lay down and pulled the quilt over him.  </span><span id="en7932">His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him.  </span><span id="en7934">With a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old, ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing sleep. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7937">He woke up, hearing someone come in.  </span><span id="en7939">He opened his eyes and saw Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or not.  </span><span id="en7941">Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though trying to recall something. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7944">"Ah, you are not asleep!  </span><span id="en7946">Here I am!  </span><span id="en7948">Nastasya, bring in the parcel!"  </span><span id="en7950">Razumihin shouted down the stairs. " </span><span id="en7952">You shall have the account directly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7955">"What time is it?"  </span><span id="en7957">asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en7960">"Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it's almost evening, it will be six o'clock directly.  </span><span id="en7962">You have slept more than six hours." </span></p>
<p><span id="en7965">"Good heavens!  </span><span id="en7967">Have I?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en7970">"And why not?  </span><span id="en7972">It will do you good.  </span><span id="en7974">What's the hurry?  </span><span id="en7976">A tryst, is it?  </span><span id="en7978">We've all time before us.  </span><span id="en7980">I've been waiting for the last three hours for you; I've been up twice and found you asleep.  </span><span id="en7982">I've called on Zossimov twice; not at home, only fancy!  </span><span id="en7984">But no matter, he will turn up.  </span><span id="en7986">And I've been out on my own business, too.  </span><span id="en7988">You know I've been moving to-day, moving with my uncle.  </span><span id="en7990">I have an uncle living with me now.  </span><span id="en7992">But that's no matter, to business.  </span><span id="en7994">Give me the parcel, Nastasya.  </span><span id="en7996">We will open it directly.  </span><span id="en7998">And how do you feel now, brother?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8001">"I am quite well, I am not ill.  </span><span id="en8003">Razumihin, have you been here long?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8006">"I tell you I've been waiting for the last three hours." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8009">"No, before." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8012">"How do you mean?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8015">"How long have you been coming here?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8018">"Why I told you all about it this morning.  </span><span id="en8020">Don't you remember?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8023">Raskolnikov pondered.  </span><span id="en8025">The morning seemed like a dream to him.  </span><span id="en8027">He could not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8030">"Hm!"  </span><span id="en8032">said the latter, "he has forgotten.  </span><span id="en8034">I fancied then that you were not quite yourself.  </span><span id="en8036">Now you are better for your sleep....  </span><span id="en8038">You really look much better.  </span><span id="en8040">First-rate!  </span><span id="en8042">Well, to business.  </span><span id="en8044">Look here, my dear boy." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8047">He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8050">"Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart.  </span><span id="en8052">For we must make a man of you.  </span><span id="en8054">Let's begin from the top.  </span><span id="en8056">Do you see this cap?"  </span><span id="en8058">he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap. " </span><span id="en8060">Let me try it on." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8063">"Presently, afterwards," said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8066">"Come, Rodya, my boy, don't oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and I shan't sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.  </span><span id="en8068">Just right!"  </span><span id="en8070">he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, "just your size!  </span><span id="en8072">A proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in its own way.  </span><span id="en8074">Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps.  </span><span id="en8076">People think he does it from slavish politeness, but it's simply because he is ashamed of his bird's nest; he is such a boastful fellow!  </span><span id="en8078">Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of headgear: this Palmerston"—he took from the corner Raskolnikov's old, battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston—"or this jewel!  </span><span id="en8080">Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it, Nastasya!"  </span><span id="en8082">he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not speak. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8085">"Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say," answered Nastasya. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8088">"Twenty copecks, silly!"  </span><span id="en8090">he cried, offended. " </span><span id="en8092">Why, nowadays you would cost more than that—eighty copecks!  </span><span id="en8094">And that only because it has been worn.  </span><span id="en8096">And it's bought on condition that when's it's worn out, they will give you another next year.  </span><span id="en8098">Yes, on my word!  </span><span id="en8100">Well, now let us pass to the United States of America, as they called them at school.  </span><span id="en8102">I assure you I am proud of these breeches," and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. " </span><span id="en8104">No holes, no spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat to match, quite in the fashion.  </span><span id="en8106">And its being worn really is an improvement, it's softer, smoother....  </span><span id="en8108">You see, Rodya, to my thinking, the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the seasons; if you don't insist on having asparagus in January, you keep your money in your purse; and it's the same with this purchase.  </span><span id="en8110">It's summer now, so I've been buying summer things—warmer materials will be wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...  </span><span id="en8112">especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury.  </span><span id="en8114">Come, price them!  </span><span id="en8116">What do you say?  </span><span id="en8118">Two roubles twenty-five copecks!  </span><span id="en8120">And remember the condition: if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing!  </span><span id="en8122">They only do business on that system at Fedyaev's; if you've bought a thing once, you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your own free will.  </span><span id="en8124">Now for the boots.  </span><span id="en8126">What do you say?  </span><span id="en8128">You see that they are a bit worn, but they'll last a couple of months, for it's foreign work and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last week—he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.  </span><span id="en8130">Price—a rouble and a half.  </span><span id="en8132">A bargain?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8135">"But perhaps they won't fit," observed Nastasya. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8138">"Not fit?  </span><span id="en8140">Just look!"  </span><span id="en8142">and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov's old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. " </span><span id="en8144">I did not go empty-handed—they took the size from this monster.  </span><span id="en8146">We all did our best.  </span><span id="en8148">And as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that.  </span><span id="en8150">Here, to begin with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front....  </span><span id="en8152">Well now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the suit—together three roubles five copecks—a rouble and a half for the boots—for, you see, they are very good—and that makes four roubles fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes—they were bought in the lo—which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.  </span><span id="en8154">Forty-five copecks change in coppers.  </span><span id="en8156">Will you take it?  </span><span id="en8158">And so, Rodya, you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will serve, and even has a style of its own.  </span><span id="en8160">That comes from getting one's clothes from Sharmer's!  </span><span id="en8162">As for your socks and other things, I leave them to you; we've twenty-five roubles left.  </span><span id="en8164">And as for Pashenka and paying for your lodging, don't you worry.  </span><span id="en8166">I tell you she'll trust you for anything.  </span><span id="en8168">And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you will throw off your illness with your shirt." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8171">"Let me be!  </span><span id="en8173">I don't want to!"  </span><span id="en8175">Raskolnikov waved him off.  </span><span id="en8177">He had listened with disgust to Razumihin's efforts to be playful about his purchases. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8180">"Come, brother, don't tell me I've been trudging around for nothing," Razumihin insisted. " </span><span id="en8182">Nastasya, don't be bashful, but help me—that's it," and in spite of Raskolnikov's resistance he changed his linen.  </span><span id="en8184">The latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8187">"It will be long before I get rid of them," he thought. " </span><span id="en8189">What money was all that bought with?"  </span><span id="en8191">he asked at last, gazing at the wall. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8194">"Money?  </span><span id="en8196">Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your mother sent it.  </span><span id="en8198">Have you forgotten that, too?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8201">"I remember now," said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.  </span><span id="en8203">Razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8206">The door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar to Raskolnikov came in. </span></p>

<p><span id="en8210">Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face and straight flaxen hair.  </span><span id="en8212">He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on his fat finger.  </span><span id="en8214">He was twenty-seven.  </span><span id="en8216">He had on a light grey fashionable loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose, fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his watch-chain was massive.  </span><span id="en8218">In manner he was slow and, as it were, nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every instant.  </span><span id="en8220">All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever at his work. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8223">"I've been to you twice to-day, brother.  </span><span id="en8225">You see, he's come to himself," cried Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8228">"I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?"  </span><span id="en8230">said Zossimov to Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8233">"He is still depressed," Razumihin went on. " </span><span id="en8235">We've just changed his linen and he almost cried." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8238">"That's very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish it....  </span><span id="en8240">His pulse is first-rate.  </span><span id="en8242">Is your head still aching, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8245">"I am well, I am perfectly well!"  </span><span id="en8247">Raskolnikov declared positively and irritably.  </span><span id="en8249">He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the wall.  </span><span id="en8251">Zossimov watched him intently. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8254">"Very good....  </span><span id="en8256">Going on all right," he said lazily. " </span><span id="en8258">Has he eaten anything?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8261">They told him, and asked what he might have. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8264">"He may have anything...  </span><span id="en8266">soup, tea...  </span><span id="en8268">mushrooms and cucumbers, of course, you must not give him; he'd better not have meat either, and...  </span><span id="en8270">but no need to tell you that!"  </span><span id="en8272">Razumihin and he looked at each other. " </span><span id="en8274">No more medicine or anything.  </span><span id="en8276">I'll look at him again to-morrow.  </span><span id="en8278">Perhaps, to-day even...  </span><span id="en8280">but never mind..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8283">"To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk," said Razumihin. " </span><span id="en8285">We are going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Crystal." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8288">"I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don't know...  </span><span id="en8290">a little, maybe...  </span><span id="en8292">but we'll see." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8295">"Ach, what a nuisance!  </span><span id="en8297">I've got a house-warming party to-night; it's only a step from here.  </span><span id="en8299">Couldn't he come?  </span><span id="en8301">He could lie on the sofa.  </span><span id="en8303">You are coming?"  </span><span id="en8305">Razumihin said to Zossimov. " </span><span id="en8307">Don't forget, you promised." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8310">"All right, only rather later.  </span><span id="en8312">What are you going to do?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8315">"Oh, nothing—tea, vodka, herrings.  </span><span id="en8317">There will be a pie...  </span><span id="en8319">just our friends." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8322">"And who?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8325">"All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and he is new too—he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some business of his.  </span><span id="en8327">We meet once in five years." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8330">"What is he?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8333">"He's been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a little pension.  </span><span id="en8335">He is sixty-five—not worth talking about....  </span><span id="en8337">But I am fond of him.  </span><span id="en8339">Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation Department here...  </span><span id="en8341">But you know him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8344">"Is he a relation of yours, too?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8347">"A very distant one.  </span><span id="en8349">But why are you scowling?  </span><span id="en8351">Because you quarrelled once, won't you come then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8354">"I don't care a damn for him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8357">"So much the better.  </span><span id="en8359">Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a government clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8362">"Do tell me, please, what you or he"—Zossimov nodded at Raskolnikov—"can have in common with this Zametov?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8365">"Oh, you particular gentleman!  </span><span id="en8367">Principles!  </span><span id="en8369">You are worked by principles, as it were by springs; you won't venture to turn round on your own account.  </span><span id="en8371">If a man is a nice fellow, that's the only principle I go upon.  </span><span id="en8373">Zametov is a delightful person." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8376">"Though he does take bribes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8379">"Well, he does!  </span><span id="en8381">and what of it?  </span><span id="en8383">I don't care if he does take bribes," Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. " </span><span id="en8385">I don't praise him for taking bribes.  </span><span id="en8387">I only say he is a nice man in his own way!  </span><span id="en8389">But if one looks at men in all ways—are there many good ones left?  </span><span id="en8391">Why, I am sure I shouldn't be worth a baked onion myself...  </span><span id="en8393">perhaps with you thrown in." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8396">"That's too little; I'd give two for you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8399">"And I wouldn't give more than one for you.  </span><span id="en8401">No more of your jokes!  </span><span id="en8403">Zametov is no more than a boy.  </span><span id="en8405">I can pull his hair and one must draw him not repel him.  </span><span id="en8407">You'll never improve a man by repelling him, especially a boy.  </span><span id="en8409">One has to be twice as careful with a boy.  </span><span id="en8411">Oh, you progressive dullards!  </span><span id="en8413">You don't understand.  </span><span id="en8415">You harm yourselves running another man down....  </span><span id="en8417">But if you want to know, we really have something in common." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8420">"I should like to know what." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8423">"Why, it's all about a house-painter....  </span><span id="en8425">We are getting him out of a mess!  </span><span id="en8427">Though indeed there's nothing to fear now.  </span><span id="en8429">The matter is absolutely self-evident.  </span><span id="en8431">We only put on steam." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8434">"A painter?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8437">"Why, haven't I told you about it?  </span><span id="en8439">I only told you the beginning then about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman.  </span><span id="en8441">Well, the painter is mixed up in it..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8444">"Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...  </span><span id="en8446">partly...  </span><span id="en8448">for one reason....  </span><span id="en8450">I read about it in the papers, too...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8453">"Lizaveta was murdered, too," Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en8455">She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door listening. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8458">"Lizaveta," murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8461">"Lizaveta, who sold old clothes.  </span><span id="en8463">Didn't you know her?  </span><span id="en8465">She used to come here.  </span><span id="en8467">She mended a shirt for you, too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8470">Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them.  </span><span id="en8472">He felt his arms and legs as lifeless as though they had been cut off.  </span><span id="en8474">He did not attempt to move, but stared obstinately at the flower. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8477">"But what about the painter?"  </span><span id="en8479">Zossimov interrupted Nastasya's chatter with marked displeasure.  </span><span id="en8481">She sighed and was silent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8484">"Why, he was accused of the murder," Razumihin went on hotly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8487">"Was there evidence against him then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8490">"Evidence, indeed!  </span><span id="en8492">Evidence that was no evidence, and that's what we have to prove.  </span><span id="en8494">It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and Pestryakov, at first.  </span><span id="en8496">Foo!  </span><span id="en8498">how stupidly it's all done, it makes one sick, though it's not one's business!  </span><span id="en8500">Pestryakov may be coming to-night....  </span><span id="en8502">By the way, Rodya, you've heard about the business already; it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the police office while they were talking about it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8505">Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en8507">He did not stir. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8510">"But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you.  </span><span id="en8512">What a busybody you are!"  </span><span id="en8514">Zossimov observed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8517">"Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway," shouted Razumihin, bringing his fist down on the table. " </span><span id="en8519">What's the most offensive is not their lying—one can always forgive lying—lying is a delightful thing, for it leads to truth—what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying....  </span><span id="en8521">I respect Porfiry, but...  </span><span id="en8523">What threw them out at first?  </span><span id="en8525">The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter it was open.  </span><span id="en8527">So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the murderers—that was their logic!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8530">"But don't excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not help that....  </span><span id="en8532">And, by the way, I've met that man Koch.  </span><span id="en8534">He used to buy unredeemed pledges from the old woman?  </span><span id="en8536">Eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8539">"Yes, he is a swindler.  </span><span id="en8541">He buys up bad debts, too.  </span><span id="en8543">He makes a profession of it.  </span><span id="en8545">But enough of him!  </span><span id="en8547">Do you know what makes me angry?  </span><span id="en8549">It's their sickening rotten, petrified routine....  </span><span id="en8551">And this case might be the means of introducing a new method.  </span><span id="en8553">One can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real man.  </span><span id="en8555">'We have facts,' they say.  </span><span id="en8557">But facts are not everything—at least half the business lies in how you interpret them!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8560">"Can you interpret them, then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8563">"Anyway, one can't hold one's tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible feeling, that one might be a help if only....  </span><span id="en8565">Eh!  </span><span id="en8567">Do you know the details of the case?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8570">"I am waiting to hear about the painter." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8573">"Oh, yes!  </span><span id="en8575">Well, here's the story.  </span><span id="en8577">Early on the third day after the murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov—though they accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff—an unexpected fact turned up.  </span><span id="en8579">A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller's case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole.  </span><span id="en8581">'The day before yesterday, just after eight o'clock'—mark the day and the hour! </span><span id="en8583">—'a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and asked me to give him two roubles for them.  </span><span id="en8585">When I asked him where he got them, he said that he picked them up in the street.  </span><span id="en8587">I did not ask him anything more. </span><span id="en8589">' I am telling you Dushkin's story.  </span><span id="en8591">'I gave him a note'—a rouble that is—'for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with another.  </span><span id="en8593">It would all come to the same thing—he'd spend it on drink, so the thing had better be with me.  </span><span id="en8595">The further you hide it the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any rumours, I'll take it to the police. </span><span id="en8597">' Of course, that's all taradiddle; he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police.  </span><span id="en8599">He was simply afraid.  </span><span id="en8601">But no matter, to return to Dushkin's story.  </span><span id="en8603">'I've known this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men.  </span><span id="en8605">And though Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.  </span><span id="en8607">As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses, took his change and went out.  </span><span id="en8609">But I did not see Dmitri with him then.  </span><span id="en8611">And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe.  </span><span id="en8613">I knew them, and I felt suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges.  </span><span id="en8615">I went to the house, and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone.  </span><span id="en8617">First of all I asked, "Is Nikolay here?"  </span><span id="en8619">Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again.  </span><span id="en8621">Dmitri didn't see him again and is finishing the job alone.  </span><span id="en8623">And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on the second floor.  </span><span id="en8625">When I heard all that I did not say a word to anyone'—that's Dushkin's tale—'but I found out what I could about the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever.  </span><span id="en8627">And at eight o'clock this morning'—that was the third day, you understand—'I saw Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk—he could understand what was said to him.  </span><span id="en8629">He sat down on the bench and did not speak.  </span><span id="en8631">There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep on a bench and our two boys. " </span><span id="en8633">Have you seen Dmitri?"  </span><span id="en8635">said I. " </span><span id="en8637">No, I haven't," said he. " </span><span id="en8639">And you've not been here either?" " </span><span id="en8641">Not since the day before yesterday," said he. " </span><span id="en8643">And where did you sleep last night?" " </span><span id="en8645">In Peski, with the Kolomensky men." " </span><span id="en8647">And where did you get those ear-rings?"  </span><span id="en8649">I asked. " </span><span id="en8651">I found them in the street," and the way he said it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. " </span><span id="en8653">Did you hear what happened that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?"  </span><span id="en8655">said I. " </span><span id="en8657">No," said he, "I had not heard," and all the while he was listening, his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk.  </span><span id="en8659">I told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up.  </span><span id="en8661">I wanted to keep him. " </span><span id="en8663">Wait a bit, Nikolay," said I, "won't you have a drink?"  </span><span id="en8665">And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.  </span><span id="en8667">I have not seen him since.  </span><span id="en8669">Then my doubts were at an end—it was his doing, as clear as could be.... </span><span id="en8670">'" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8672">"I should think so," said Zossimov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8675">"Wait!  </span><span id="en8677">Hear the end.  </span><span id="en8679">Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay; they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested; the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out.  </span><span id="en8681">And the day before yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town.  </span><span id="en8683">He had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram for it.  </span><span id="en8685">They gave it to him.  </span><span id="en8687">A few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose.  </span><span id="en8689">The woman screeched her hardest; people ran in.  </span><span id="en8691">'So that's what you are up to! </span><span id="en8693">' 'Take me,' he says, 'to such-and-such a police officer; I'll confess everything. </span><span id="en8695">' Well, they took him to that police station—that is here—with a suitable escort.  </span><span id="en8697">So they asked him this and that, how old he is, 'twenty-two,' and so on.  </span><span id="en8699">At the question, 'When you were working with Dmitri, didn't you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time? </span><span id="en8701">'—answer: 'To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did not notice them. </span><span id="en8703">' 'And didn't you hear anything, any noise, and so on? </span><span id="en8705">' 'We heard nothing special. </span><span id="en8707">' 'And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed? </span><span id="en8709">' 'I never knew a thing about it.  </span><span id="en8711">The first I heard of it was from Afanasy Pavlovitch the day before yesterday. </span><span id="en8713">' 'And where did you find the ear-rings? </span><span id="en8715">' 'I found them on the pavement. </span><span id="en8717">' 'Why didn't you go to work with Dmitri the other day? </span><span id="en8719">' 'Because I was drinking. </span><span id="en8721">' 'And where were you drinking? </span><span id="en8723">' 'Oh, in such-and-such a place. </span><span id="en8725">' 'Why did you run away from Dushkin's? </span><span id="en8727">' 'Because I was awfully frightened. </span><span id="en8729">' 'What were you frightened of? </span><span id="en8731">' 'That I should be accused. </span><span id="en8733">' 'How could you be frightened, if you felt free from guilt? </span><span id="en8735">' Now, Zossimov, you may not believe me, that question was put literally in those words.  </span><span id="en8737">I know it for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly!  </span><span id="en8739">What do you say to that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8742">"Well, anyway, there's the evidence." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8745">"I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question, of their own idea of themselves.  </span><span id="en8747">Well, so they squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed: 'I did not find it in the street, but in the flat where I was painting with Dmitri. </span><span id="en8749">' 'And how was that? </span><span id="en8751">' 'Why, Dmitri and I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.  </span><span id="en8753">I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I ran right against the porter and some gentlemen—and how many gentlemen were there I don't remember.  </span><span id="en8755">And the porter swore at me, and the other porter swore, too, and the porter's wife came out, and swore at us, too; and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us, too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way.  </span><span id="en8757">I got hold of Dmitri's hair and knocked him down and began beating him.  </span><span id="en8759">And Dmitri, too, caught me by the hair and began beating me.  </span><span id="en8761">But we did it all not for temper but in a friendly way, for sport.  </span><span id="en8763">And then Dmitri escaped and ran into the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things.  </span><span id="en8765">I began putting them together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the corner by the door, I stepped on the box.  </span><span id="en8767">I saw it lying there wrapped up in paper.  </span><span id="en8769">I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them, and in the box were the ear-rings.... </span><span id="en8770">'" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8772">"Behind the door?  </span><span id="en8774">Lying behind the door?  </span><span id="en8776">Behind the door?"  </span><span id="en8778">Raskolnikov cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8781">"Yes...  </span><span id="en8783">why?  </span><span id="en8785">What's the matter?  </span><span id="en8787">What's wrong?"  </span><span id="en8789">Razumihin, too, got up from his seat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8792">"Nothing," Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall.  </span><span id="en8794">All were silent for a while. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8797">"He must have waked from a dream," Razumihin said at last, looking inquiringly at Zossimov.  </span><span id="en8799">The latter slightly shook his head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en8802">"Well, go on," said Zossimov. " </span><span id="en8804">What next?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8807">"What next?  </span><span id="en8809">As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got a rouble from him.  </span><span id="en8811">He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and went off drinking.  </span><span id="en8813">He keeps repeating his old story about the murder: 'I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday. </span><span id="en8815">' 'And why didn't you come to the police till now? </span><span id="en8817">' 'I was frightened. </span><span id="en8819">' 'And why did you try to hang yourself? </span><span id="en8821">' 'From anxiety. </span><span id="en8823">' 'What anxiety? </span><span id="en8825">' 'That I should be accused of it. </span><span id="en8827">' Well, that's the whole story.  </span><span id="en8829">And now what do you suppose they deduced from that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8832">"Why, there's no supposing.  </span><span id="en8834">There's a clue, such as it is, a fact.  </span><span id="en8836">You wouldn't have your painter set free?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8839">"Now they've simply taken him for the murderer.  </span><span id="en8841">They haven't a shadow of doubt." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8844">"That's nonsense.  </span><span id="en8846">You are excited.  </span><span id="en8848">But what about the ear-rings?  </span><span id="en8850">You must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old woman's box have come into Nikolay's hands, they must have come there somehow.  </span><span id="en8852">That's a good deal in such a case." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8855">"How did they get there?  </span><span id="en8857">How did they get there?"  </span><span id="en8859">cried Razumihin. " </span><span id="en8861">How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature—how can you fail to see the character of the man in the whole story?  </span><span id="en8863">Don't you see at once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy truth?  </span><span id="en8865">They came into his hand precisely as he has told us—he stepped on the box and picked it up." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8868">"The holy truth!  </span><span id="en8870">But didn't he own himself that he told a lie at first?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8873">"Listen to me, listen attentively.  </span><span id="en8875">The porter and Koch and Pestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who was sitting in the porter's lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his arm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his hair, beating him, too.  </span><span id="en8877">They lay right across the way, blocking the thoroughfare.  </span><span id="en8879">They were sworn at on all sides while they 'like children' (the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another, squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing one another like children, they ran into the street.  </span><span id="en8881">Now take careful note.  </span><span id="en8883">The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they found them!  </span><span id="en8885">If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning, robbery?  </span><span id="en8887">They'd just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.  </span><span id="en8889">And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8892">"Of course it is strange!  </span><span id="en8894">It's impossible, indeed, but..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8896">"No, brother, no  </span><i><span id="en8897">buts </span></i><span id="en8898">. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay's hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him—although the explanation given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously against him—one must take into consideration the facts which prove him innocent, especially as they are facts that  </span><i><span id="en8899">cannot be denied </span></i><span id="en8901">. And do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact—resting simply on a psychological impossibility—as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution?  </span><span id="en8903">No, they won't accept it, they certainly won't, because they found the jewel-case and the man tried to hang himself, 'which he could not have done if he hadn't felt guilty. </span><span id="en8905">' That's the point, that's what excites me, you must understand!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8910">"Oh, I see you are excited!  </span><span id="en8912">Wait a bit.  </span><span id="en8914">I forgot to ask you; what proof is there that the box came from the old woman?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8917">"That's been proved," said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning. " </span><span id="en8919">Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who proved conclusively that it was his." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8922">"That's bad.  </span><span id="en8924">Now another point.  </span><span id="en8926">Did anyone see Nikolay at the time that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no evidence about that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8929">"Nobody did see him," Razumihin answered with vexation. " </span><span id="en8931">That's the worst of it.  </span><span id="en8933">Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.  </span><span id="en8935">They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether there actually were men at work in it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8938">"Hm!...  </span><span id="en8940">So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating one another and laughing.  </span><span id="en8942">That constitutes a strong presumption, but...  </span><span id="en8944">How do you explain the facts yourself?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8947">"How do I explain them?  </span><span id="en8949">What is there to explain?  </span><span id="en8951">It's clear.  </span><span id="en8953">At any rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and the jewel-case points to it.  </span><span id="en8955">The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.  </span><span id="en8957">The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked at the door.  </span><span id="en8959">Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of escape.  </span><span id="en8961">He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it.  </span><span id="en8963">He stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry; possibly he was seen, but not noticed.  </span><span id="en8965">There are lots of people going in and out.  </span><span id="en8967">He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he had other things to think of.  </span><span id="en8969">The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that he did stand there....  </span><span id="en8971">That's how I explain it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8974">"Too clever!  </span><span id="en8976">No, my boy, you're too clever.  </span><span id="en8978">That beats everything." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8981">"But, why, why?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en8984">"Why, because everything fits too well...  </span><span id="en8986">it's too melodramatic." </span></p>
<p><span id="en8989">"A-ach!"  </span><span id="en8991">Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present. </span></p>

<p><span id="en8995">This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance, and a cautious and sour countenance.  </span><span id="en8997">He began by stopping short in the doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment, as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.  </span><span id="en8999">Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov's low and narrow "cabin."  </span><span id="en9001">With the same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled, unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him.  </span><span id="en9003">Then with the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat.  </span><span id="en9005">A constrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting took place.  </span><span id="en9006">Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that he would get nothing in this "cabin" by attempting to overawe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity, emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov: </span></p>
<p><span id="en9008">"Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9011">Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not Razumihin anticipated him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9014">"Here he is lying on the sofa!  </span><span id="en9016">What do you want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9019">This familiar "what do you want" seemed to cut the ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman.  </span><span id="en9021">He was turning to Razumihin, but checked himself in time and turned to Zossimov again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9024">"This is Raskolnikov," mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him.  </span><span id="en9026">Then he gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible.  </span><span id="en9028">Then he lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch in a round hunter's case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly and lazily proceeded to put it back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9031">Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger.  </span><span id="en9033">Now that his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack.  </span><span id="en9035">But the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder, then suspicion and even alarm.  </span><span id="en9036">When Zossimov said "This is Raskolnikov" he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but weak and breaking, voice articulated: </span></p>
<p><span id="en9038">"Yes, I am Raskolnikov!  </span><span id="en9040">What do you want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9042">The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively: </span></p>
<p><span id="en9044">"Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin.  </span><span id="en9046">I believe I have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9049">But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9052">"Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no information?"  </span><span id="en9054">asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9057">In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling.  </span><span id="en9059">A look of dismay came into Luzhin's face.  </span><span id="en9061">Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9064">"I had presumed and calculated," he faltered, "that a letter posted more than ten days, if not a fortnight ago..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9067">"I say, why are you standing in the doorway?"  </span><span id="en9069">Razumihin interrupted suddenly. " </span><span id="en9071">If you've something to say, sit down.  </span><span id="en9073">Nastasya and you are so crowded.  </span><span id="en9075">Nastasya, make room.  </span><span id="en9077">Here's a chair, thread your way in!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9080">He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to "thread his way in."  </span><span id="en9082">The minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying and stumbling.  </span><span id="en9084">Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9087">"No need to be nervous," the latter blurted out. " </span><span id="en9089">Rodya has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and has got an appetite.  </span><span id="en9091">This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.  </span><span id="en9093">I am a comrade of Rodya's, like him, formerly a student, and now I am nursing him; so don't you take any notice of us, but go on with your business." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9096">"Thank you.  </span><span id="en9098">But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation?"  </span><span id="en9100">Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9103">"N-no," mumbled Zossimov; "you may amuse him."  </span><span id="en9105">He yawned again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9108">"He has been conscious a long time, since the morning," went on Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps, because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a student. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9111">"Your mamma," began Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9114">"Hm!"  </span><span id="en9116">Razumihin cleared his throat loudly.  </span><span id="en9118">Luzhin looked at him inquiringly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9121">"That's all right, go on." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9124">Luzhin shrugged his shoulders. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9127">"Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in her neighbourhood.  </span><span id="en9129">On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my astonishment..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9132">"I know, I know!"  </span><span id="en9134">Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation. " </span><span id="en9135">So you are the  </span><i><span id="en9136">fiancé </span></i><span id="en9138">? I know, and that's enough!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9142">There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch's being offended this time, but he said nothing.  </span><span id="en9144">He made a violent effort to understand what it all meant.  </span><span id="en9146">There was a moment's silence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9149">Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him.  </span><span id="en9151">There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch's whole appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of "fiancé" so unceremoniously applied to him.  </span><span id="en9153">In the first place, it was evident, far too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his betrothed—a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding, indeed.  </span><span id="en9155">Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé.  </span><span id="en9157">All his clothes were fresh from the tailor's and were all right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate.  </span><span id="en9159">Even the stylish new round hat had the same significance.  </span><span id="en9161">Pyotr Petrovitch treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands.  </span><span id="en9163">The exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale, if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in his hand for show.  </span><span id="en9165">Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr Petrovitch's attire.  </span><span id="en9167">He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade, light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en9169">His very fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.  </span><span id="en9171">His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides, growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin.  </span><span id="en9173">Even his hair, touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled at a hairdresser's, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.  </span><span id="en9175">If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other causes.  </span><span id="en9177">After scanning Mr.  </span><span id="en9179">Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as before. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9182">But Mr.  </span><span id="en9184">Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no notice of their oddities. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9187">"I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation," he began, again breaking the silence with an effort. " </span><span id="en9189">If I had been aware of your illness I should have come earlier.  </span><span id="en9191">But you know what business is.  </span><span id="en9193">I have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture.  </span><span id="en9195">I am expecting your mamma and sister any minute." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9198">Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed some excitement.  </span><span id="en9199">Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing followed, he went on: </span></p>
<p><span id="en9201">"...  </span><span id="en9203">Any minute.  </span><span id="en9205">I have found a lodging for them on their arrival." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9208">"Where?"  </span><span id="en9210">asked Raskolnikov weakly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9213">"Very near here, in Bakaleyev's house." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9216">"That's in Voskresensky," put in Razumihin. " </span><span id="en9218">There are two storeys of rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I've been there." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9221">"Yes, rooms..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9224">"A disgusting place—filthy, stinking and, what's more, of doubtful character.  </span><span id="en9226">Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer people living there.  </span><span id="en9228">And I went there about a scandalous business.  </span><span id="en9230">It's cheap, though..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9233">"I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger in Petersburg myself," Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. " </span><span id="en9235">However, the two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...  </span><span id="en9237">I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat," he said, addressing Raskolnikov, "and I am having it done up.  </span><span id="en9239">And meanwhile I am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me of Bakaleyev's house, too..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9242">"Lebeziatnikov?"  </span><span id="en9244">said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9247">"Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry.  </span><span id="en9249">Do you know him?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9252">"Yes...  </span><span id="en9254">no," Raskolnikov answered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9257">"Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry.  </span><span id="en9259">I was once his guardian....  </span><span id="en9261">A very nice young man and advanced.  </span><span id="en9263">I like to meet young people: one learns new things from them."  </span><span id="en9265">Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9268">"How do you mean?"  </span><span id="en9270">asked Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9273">"In the most serious and essential matters," Pyotr Petrovitch replied, as though delighted at the question. " </span><span id="en9275">You see, it's ten years since I visited Petersburg.  </span><span id="en9277">All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.  </span><span id="en9279">And it's my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the younger generation.  </span><span id="en9281">And I confess I am delighted..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9284">"At what?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9287">"Your question is a wide one.  </span><span id="en9289">I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9292">"That's true," Zossimov let drop. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9295">"Nonsense!  </span><span id="en9297">There's no practicality."  </span><span id="en9299">Razumihin flew at him. " </span><span id="en9301">Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from heaven.  </span><span id="en9303">And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life.  </span><span id="en9305">Ideas, if you like, are fermenting," he said to Pyotr Petrovitch, "and desire for good exists, though it's in a childish form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.  </span><span id="en9307">Anyway, there's no practicality.  </span><span id="en9309">Practicality goes well shod." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9312">"I don't agree with you," Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident enjoyment. " </span><span id="en9314">Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes, but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment.  </span><span id="en9316">If little has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.  </span><span id="en9318">It's my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been accomplished already.  </span><span id="en9320">New valuable ideas, new valuable works are circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.  </span><span id="en9322">Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been rooted up and turned into ridicule....  </span><span id="en9324">In a word, we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great thing..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9327">"He's learnt it by heart to show off!"  </span><span id="en9329">Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9332">"What?"  </span><span id="en9334">asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received no reply. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9337">"That's all true," Zossimov hastened to interpose. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9340">"Isn't it so?"  </span><span id="en9342">Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov. " </span><span id="en9344">You must admit," he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness—he almost added "young man"—"that there is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and economic truth..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9347">"A commonplace." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9350">"No, not a commonplace!  </span><span id="en9352">Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, 'love thy neighbour,' what came of it?"  </span><span id="en9354">Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with excessive haste. " </span><span id="en9356">It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked.  </span><span id="en9358">As a Russian proverb has it, 'Catch several hares and you won't catch one. </span><span id="en9360">' Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest.  </span><span id="en9362">You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole.  </span><span id="en9364">Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society—the more whole coats, so to say—the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too.  </span><span id="en9366">Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to pass my neighbour's getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general advance.  </span><span id="en9368">The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality.  </span><span id="en9370">And yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9373">"Excuse me, I've very little wit myself," Razumihin cut in sharply, "and so let us drop it.  </span><span id="en9375">I began this discussion with an object, but I've grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that, by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that.  </span><span id="en9377">You are in a hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don't blame you, that's quite pardonable.  </span><span id="en9379">I only wanted to find out what sort of man you are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire.  </span><span id="en9381">That's enough!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9384">"Excuse me, sir," said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive dignity. " </span><span id="en9386">Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9389">"Oh, my dear sir...  </span><span id="en9391">how could I?...  </span><span id="en9393">Come, that's enough," Razumihin concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous conversation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9396">Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal.  </span><span id="en9398">He made up his mind to take leave in another minute or two. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9401">"I trust our acquaintance," he said, addressing Raskolnikov, "may, upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware, become closer...  </span><span id="en9403">Above all, I hope for your return to health..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9406">Raskolnikov did not even turn his head.  </span><span id="en9408">Pyotr Petrovitch began getting up from his chair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9411">"One of her customers must have killed her," Zossimov declared positively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9414">"Not a doubt of it," replied Razumihin. " </span><span id="en9416">Porfiry doesn't give his opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9419">"Examining them?"  </span><span id="en9421">Raskolnikov asked aloud. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9424">"Yes.  </span><span id="en9426">What then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9429">"Nothing." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9432">"How does he get hold of them?"  </span><span id="en9434">asked Zossimov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9437">"Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9440">"It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian!  </span><span id="en9442">The boldness of it!  </span><span id="en9444">The coolness!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9447">"That's just what it wasn't!"  </span><span id="en9449">interposed Razumihin. " </span><span id="en9451">That's what throws you all off the scent.  </span><span id="en9453">But I maintain that he is not cunning, not practised, and probably this was his first crime!  </span><span id="en9455">The supposition that it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn't work.  </span><span id="en9457">Suppose him to have been inexperienced, and it's clear that it was only a chance that saved him—and chance may do anything.  </span><span id="en9459">Why, he did not foresee obstacles, perhaps!  </span><span id="en9461">And how did he set to work?  </span><span id="en9463">He took jewels worth ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the old woman's trunks, her rags—and they found fifteen hundred roubles, besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest!  </span><span id="en9465">He did not know how to rob; he could only murder.  </span><span id="en9467">It was his first crime, I assure you, his first crime; he lost his head.  </span><span id="en9469">And he got off more by luck than good counsel!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9472">"You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?"  </span><span id="en9474">Pyotr Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov.  </span><span id="en9476">He was standing, hat and gloves in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases.  </span><span id="en9478">He was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9481">"Yes.  </span><span id="en9483">You've heard of it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9486">"Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9489">"Do you know the details?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9492">"I can't say that; but another circumstance interests me in the case—the whole question, so to say.  </span><span id="en9494">Not to speak of the fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere, what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes, too, crime is increasing proportionately.  </span><span id="en9496">In one place one hears of a student's robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain....  </span><span id="en9498">And if this old woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society—for peasants don't pawn gold trinkets—how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9501">"There are many economic changes," put in Zossimov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9504">"How are we to explain it?"  </span><span id="en9506">Razumihin caught him up. " </span><span id="en9508">It might be explained by our inveterate impracticality." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9511">"How do you mean?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9514">"What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes?  </span><span id="en9516">'Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I want to make haste to get rich too. </span><span id="en9518">' I don't remember the exact words, but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or working!  </span><span id="en9520">We've grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking on crutches, to having our food chewed for us.  </span><span id="en9522">Then the great hour struck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours." </span></p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"><span id="en9525">     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant. </span><br><span id="en9528">     —TRANSLATOR'S NOTE. </span><br></div>
<p><span id="en9532">"But morality?  </span><span id="en9534">And so to speak, principles..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9537">"But why do you worry about it?"  </span><span id="en9539">Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. " </span><span id="en9541">It's in accordance with your theory!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9544">"In accordance with my theory?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9547">"Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and it follows that people may be killed..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9550">"Upon my word!"  </span><span id="en9552">cried Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9555">"No, that's not so," put in Zossimov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9558">Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing painfully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9561">"There's a measure in all things," Luzhin went on superciliously. " </span><span id="en9563">Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to suppose..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9565">"And is it true," Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, "is it true that you told your  </span><i><span id="en9566">fiancée </span></i><span id="en9568">...  </span><span id="en9570">within an hour of her acceptance, that what pleased you most...  </span><span id="en9572">was that she was a beggar...  </span><span id="en9574">because it was better to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9578">"Upon my word," Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with confusion, "to distort my words in this way!  </span><span id="en9580">Excuse me, allow me to assure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say, has been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I...  </span><span id="en9582">suspect who...  </span><span id="en9584">in a word...  </span><span id="en9586">this arrow...  </span><span id="en9588">in a word, your mamma...  </span><span id="en9590">She seemed to me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat high-flown and romantic way of thinking....  </span><span id="en9592">But I was a thousand miles from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in so fanciful a way....  </span><span id="en9594">And indeed...  </span><span id="en9596">indeed..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9599">"I tell you what," cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, "I tell you what." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9602">"What?"  </span><span id="en9604">Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.  </span><span id="en9606">Silence lasted for some seconds. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9609">"Why, if ever again...  </span><span id="en9611">you dare to mention a single word...  </span><span id="en9613">about my mother...  </span><span id="en9615">I shall send you flying downstairs!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9618">"What's the matter with you?"  </span><span id="en9620">cried Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9623">"So that's how it is?"  </span><span id="en9625">Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. " </span><span id="en9627">Let me tell you, sir," he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard, "at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more.  </span><span id="en9629">I could forgive a great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you...  </span><span id="en9631">never after this..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9634">"I am not ill," cried Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9637">"So much the worse..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9640">"Go to hell!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9643">But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him pass.  </span><span id="en9645">Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone, he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door.  </span><span id="en9647">And even the curve of his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9650">"How could you—how could you!"  </span><span id="en9652">Razumihin said, shaking his head in perplexity. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9655">"Let me alone—let me alone all of you!"  </span><span id="en9657">Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy. " </span><span id="en9659">Will you ever leave off tormenting me?  </span><span id="en9661">I am not afraid of you!  </span><span id="en9663">I am not afraid of anyone, anyone now!  </span><span id="en9665">Get away from me!  </span><span id="en9667">I want to be alone, alone, alone!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9670">"Come along," said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9673">"But we can't leave him like this!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9676">"Come along," Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out.  </span><span id="en9678">Razumihin thought a minute and ran to overtake him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9681">"It might be worse not to obey him," said Zossimov on the stairs. " </span><span id="en9683">He mustn't be irritated." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9686">"What's the matter with him?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9689">"If only he could get some favourable shock, that's what would do it!  </span><span id="en9691">At first he was better....  </span><span id="en9693">You know he has got something on his mind!  </span><span id="en9695">Some fixed idea weighing on him....  </span><span id="en9697">I am very much afraid so; he must have!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9700">"Perhaps it's that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en9702">From his conversation I gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a letter about it just before his illness...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9705">"Yes, confound the man!  </span><span id="en9707">he may have upset the case altogether.  </span><span id="en9709">But have you noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to anything except one point on which he seems excited—that's the murder?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9712">"Yes, yes," Razumihin agreed, "I noticed that, too.  </span><span id="en9714">He is interested, frightened.  </span><span id="en9716">It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police office; he fainted." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9719">"Tell me more about that this evening and I'll tell you something afterwards.  </span><span id="en9721">He interests me very much!  </span><span id="en9723">In half an hour I'll go and see him again....  </span><span id="en9725">There'll be no inflammation though." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9728">"Thanks!  </span><span id="en9730">And I'll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him through Nastasya...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9733">Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya, but she still lingered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9736">"Won't you have some tea now?"  </span><span id="en9738">she asked. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9741">"Later!  </span><span id="en9743">I am sleepy!  </span><span id="en9745">Leave me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9748">He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out. </span></p>

<p><span id="en9752">But as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again and began dressing.  </span><span id="en9754">Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him of late.  </span><span id="en9756">It was the first moment of a strange sudden calm.  </span><span id="en9758">His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was evident in them. " </span><span id="en9760">To-day, to-day," he muttered to himself.  </span><span id="en9762">He understood that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him strength and self-confidence.  </span><span id="en9764">He hoped, moreover, that he would not fall down in the street.  </span><span id="en9766">When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment's thought put it in his pocket.  </span><span id="en9768">It was twenty-five roubles.  </span><span id="en9770">He took also all the copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.  </span><span id="en9772">Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and glanced in at the open kitchen door.  </span><span id="en9774">Nastasya was standing with her back to him, blowing up the landlady's samovar.  </span><span id="en9776">She heard nothing.  </span><span id="en9778">Who would have dreamed of his going out, indeed?  </span><span id="en9780">A minute later he was in the street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9783">It was nearly eight o'clock, the sun was setting.  </span><span id="en9785">It was as stifling as before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air.  </span><span id="en9787">His head felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face.  </span><span id="en9788">He did not know and did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: "that all  </span><i><span id="en9789">this </span></i><span id="en9790"> must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would not return home without it, because he  </span><i><span id="en9791">would not go on living like that </span></i><span id="en9793">." How, with what to make an end?  </span><span id="en9795">He had not an idea about it, he did not even want to think of it.  </span><span id="en9797">He drove away thought; thought tortured him.  </span><span id="en9799">All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be changed "one way or another," he repeated with desperate and immovable self-confidence and determination. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9804">From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay Market.  </span><span id="en9806">A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very sentimental song.  </span><span id="en9808">He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood on the pavement in front of him.  </span><span id="en9810">She was dressed up in a crinoline, a mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very old and shabby.  </span><span id="en9812">In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from the shop.  </span><span id="en9814">Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five copeck piece and put it in the girl's hand.  </span><span id="en9816">She broke off abruptly on a sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder "Come on," and both moved on to the next shop. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9819">"Do you like street music?"  </span><span id="en9821">said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged man standing idly by him.  </span><span id="en9823">The man looked at him, startled and wondering. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9826">"I love to hear singing to a street organ," said Raskolnikov, and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject—"I like it on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings—they must be damp—when all the passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet snow is falling straight down, when there's no wind—you know what I mean? </span><span id="en9828">—and the street lamps shine through it..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9831">"I don't know....  </span><span id="en9833">Excuse me..."  </span><span id="en9835">muttered the stranger, frightened by the question and Raskolnikov's strange manner, and he crossed over to the other side of the street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9838">Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay Market, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but they were not there now.  </span><span id="en9840">Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandler's shop. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9843">"Isn't there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9846">"All sorts of people keep booths here," answered the young man, glancing superciliously at Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9849">"What's his name?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9852">"What he was christened." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9855">"Aren't you a Zaraïsky man, too?  </span><span id="en9857">Which province?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9860">The young man looked at Raskolnikov again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9863">"It's not a province, your excellency, but a district.  </span><span id="en9865">Graciously forgive me, your excellency!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9868">"Is that a tavern at the top there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9871">"Yes, it's an eating-house and there's a billiard-room and you'll find princesses there too....  </span><span id="en9873">La-la!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9876">Raskolnikov crossed the square.  </span><span id="en9878">In that corner there was a dense crowd of peasants.  </span><span id="en9880">He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking at the faces.  </span><span id="en9882">He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into conversation with people.  </span><span id="en9884">But the peasants took no notice of him; they were all shouting in groups together.  </span><span id="en9886">He stood and thought a little and took a turning to the right in the direction of V. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9889">He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading from the market-place to Sadovy Street.  </span><span id="en9891">Of late he had often felt drawn to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might feel more so. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9894">Now he walked along, thinking of nothing.  </span><span id="en9896">At that point there is a great block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses; women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their indoor clothes.  </span><span id="en9898">Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement, especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in the lower storeys.  </span><span id="en9900">From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.  </span><span id="en9902">A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking.  </span><span id="en9904">A drunken soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road, swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had forgotten where.  </span><span id="en9906">One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead drunk was lying right across the road.  </span><span id="en9908">Raskolnikov joined the throng of women, who were talking in husky voices.  </span><span id="en9910">They were bare-headed and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes.  </span><span id="en9912">There were women of forty and some not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9915">He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and uproar in the saloon below....  </span><span id="en9917">someone could be heard within dancing frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air.  </span><span id="en9919">He listened intently, gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement. </span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p><span id="en9921">"Oh, my handsome soldier </span><br><span id="en9922">
Don't beat me for nothing," </span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><span id="en9924">trilled the thin voice of the singer.  </span><span id="en9926">Raskolnikov felt a great desire to make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9929">"Shall I go in?"  </span><span id="en9931">he thought. " </span><span id="en9933">They are laughing.  </span><span id="en9935">From drink.  </span><span id="en9937">Shall I get drunk?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9940">"Won't you come in?"  </span><span id="en9942">one of the women asked him.  </span><span id="en9944">Her voice was still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not repulsive—the only one of the group. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9947">"Why, she's pretty," he said, drawing himself up and looking at her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9950">She smiled, much pleased at the compliment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9953">"You're very nice looking yourself," she said. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9956">"Isn't he thin though!"  </span><span id="en9958">observed another woman in a deep bass. " </span><span id="en9960">Have you just come out of a hospital?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9963">"They're all generals' daughters, it seems, but they have all snub noses," interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing a loose coat. " </span><span id="en9965">See how jolly they are." </span></p>
<p><span id="en9968">"Go along with you!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9971">"I'll go, sweetie!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9974">And he darted down into the saloon below.  </span><span id="en9976">Raskolnikov moved on. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9979">"I say, sir," the girl shouted after him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9982">"What is it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9985">She hesitated. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9988">"I'll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but now I feel shy.  </span><span id="en9990">Give me six copecks for a drink, there's a nice young man!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9993">Raskolnikov gave her what came first—fifteen copecks. </span></p>
<p><span id="en9996">"Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en9999">"What's your name?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10002">"Ask for Duclida." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10005">"Well, that's too much," one of the women observed, shaking her head at Duclida. " </span><span id="en10007">I don't know how you can ask like that.  </span><span id="en10009">I believe I should drop with shame...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10012">Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker.  </span><span id="en10014">She was a pock-marked wench of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen.  </span><span id="en10016">She made her criticism quietly and earnestly. " </span><span id="en10018">Where is it," thought Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en10020">Where is it I've read that someone condemned to death says or thinks, an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he'd only room to stand, and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die at once!  </span><span id="en10022">Only to live, to live and live!  </span><span id="en10024">Life, whatever it may be!...  </span><span id="en10026">How true it is!  </span><span id="en10028">Good God, how true!  </span><span id="en10030">Man is a vile creature!...  </span><span id="en10032">And vile is he who calls him vile for that," he added a moment later. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10035">He went into another street. " </span><span id="en10037">Bah, the Palais de Cristal!  </span><span id="en10039">Razumihin was just talking of the Palais de Cristal.  </span><span id="en10041">But what on earth was it I wanted?  </span><span id="en10043">Yes, the newspapers....  </span><span id="en10045">Zossimov said he'd read it in the papers.  </span><span id="en10047">Have you the papers?"  </span><span id="en10049">he asked, going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were, however, rather empty.  </span><span id="en10051">Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne.  </span><span id="en10053">Raskolnikov fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that distance. " </span><span id="en10055">What if it is?"  </span><span id="en10057">he thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10060">"Will you have vodka?"  </span><span id="en10062">asked the waiter. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10065">"Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last five days, and I'll give you something." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10068">"Yes, sir, here's to-day's.  </span><span id="en10070">No vodka?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10073">The old newspapers and the tea were brought.  </span><span id="en10075">Raskolnikov sat down and began to look through them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10078">"Oh, damn...  </span><span id="en10080">these are the items of intelligence.  </span><span id="en10082">An accident on a staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire in Peski...  </span><span id="en10084">a fire in the Petersburg quarter...  </span><span id="en10086">another fire in the Petersburg quarter...  </span><span id="en10088">and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....  </span><span id="en10090">Ah, here it is!"  </span><span id="en10092">He found at last what he was seeking and began to read it.  </span><span id="en10094">The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers.  </span><span id="en10096">His hands shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets.  </span><span id="en10098">Suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table.  </span><span id="en10100">He looked up, it was the head clerk Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen.  </span><span id="en10102">He was in a good humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly.  </span><span id="en10104">His dark face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10107">"What, you here?"  </span><span id="en10109">he began in surprise, speaking as though he'd known him all his life. " </span><span id="en10111">Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were unconscious.  </span><span id="en10113">How strange!  </span><span id="en10115">And do you know I've been to see you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10118">Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him.  </span><span id="en10120">He laid aside the papers and turned to Zametov.  </span><span id="en10122">There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of irritable impatience was apparent in that smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10125">"I know you have," he answered. " </span><span id="en10127">I've heard it.  </span><span id="en10129">You looked for my sock....  </span><span id="en10131">And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you?  </span><span id="en10133">He says you've been with him to Luise Ivanovna's—you know, the woman you tried to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he would not understand.  </span><span id="en10135">Do you remember?  </span><span id="en10137">How could he fail to understand—it was quite clear, wasn't it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10140">"What a hot head he is!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10143">"The explosive one?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10146">"No, your friend Razumihin." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10149">"You must have a jolly life, Mr.  </span><span id="en10151">Zametov; entrance free to the most agreeable places.  </span><span id="en10153">Who's been pouring champagne into you just now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10156">"We've just been...  </span><span id="en10158">having a drink together....  </span><span id="en10160">You talk about pouring it into me!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10163">"By way of a fee!  </span><span id="en10165">You profit by everything!"  </span><span id="en10167">Raskolnikov laughed, "it's all right, my dear boy," he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. " </span><span id="en10169">I am not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that workman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of the old woman...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10172">"How do you know about it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10175">"Perhaps I know more about it than you do." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10178">"How strange you are....  </span><span id="en10180">I am sure you are still very unwell.  </span><span id="en10182">You oughtn't to have come out." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10185">"Oh, do I seem strange to you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10188">"Yes.  </span><span id="en10190">What are you doing, reading the papers?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10193">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10196">"There's a lot about the fires." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10199">"No, I am not reading about the fires."  </span><span id="en10201">Here he looked mysteriously at Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. " </span><span id="en10203">No, I am not reading about the fires," he went on, winking at Zametov. " </span><span id="en10205">But confess now, my dear fellow, you're awfully anxious to know what I am reading about?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10208">"I am not in the least.  </span><span id="en10210">Mayn't I ask a question?  </span><span id="en10212">Why do you keep on...?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10215">"Listen, you are a man of culture and education?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10218">"I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium," said Zametov with some dignity. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10221">"Sixth class!  </span><span id="en10223">Ah, my cock-sparrow!  </span><span id="en10225">With your parting and your rings—you are a gentleman of fortune.  </span><span id="en10227">Foo!  </span><span id="en10229">what a charming boy!"  </span><span id="en10231">Here Raskolnikov broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov's face.  </span><span id="en10233">The latter drew back, more amazed than offended. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10236">"Foo!  </span><span id="en10238">how strange you are!"  </span><span id="en10240">Zametov repeated very seriously. " </span><span id="en10242">I can't help thinking you are still delirious." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10245">"I am delirious?  </span><span id="en10247">You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow!  </span><span id="en10249">So I am strange?  </span><span id="en10251">You find me curious, do you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10254">"Yes, curious." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10257">"Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for?  </span><span id="en10259">See what a lot of papers I've made them bring me.  </span><span id="en10261">Suspicious, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10264">"Well, what is it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10267">"You prick up your ears?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10270">"How do you mean—'prick up my ears'?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10273">"I'll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you...  </span><span id="en10275">no, better 'I confess'...  </span><span id="en10277">No, that's not right either; 'I make a deposition and you take it. </span><span id="en10279">' I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and searching...."  </span><span id="en10281">he screwed up his eyes and paused. " </span><span id="en10283">I was searching—and came here on purpose to do it—for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker woman," he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov.  </span><span id="en10285">Zametov looked at him steadily, without moving or drawing his face away.  </span><span id="en10287">What struck Zametov afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10290">"What if you have been reading about it?"  </span><span id="en10292">he cried at last, perplexed and impatient. " </span><span id="en10294">That's no business of mine!  </span><span id="en10296">What of it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10299">"The same old woman," Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not heeding Zametov's explanation, "about whom you were talking in the police-office, you remember, when I fainted.  </span><span id="en10301">Well, do you understand now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10304">"What do you mean?  </span><span id="en10306">Understand...  </span><span id="en10308">what?"  </span><span id="en10310">Zametov brought out, almost alarmed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10313">Raskolnikov's set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though utterly unable to restrain himself.  </span><span id="en10315">And in one flash he recalled with extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh! </span></p>
<p><span id="en10318">"You are either mad, or..."  </span><span id="en10320">began Zametov, and he broke off, as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10323">"Or?  </span><span id="en10325">Or what?  </span><span id="en10327">What?  </span><span id="en10329">Come, tell me!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10332">"Nothing," said Zametov, getting angry, "it's all nonsense!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10335">Both were silent.  </span><span id="en10337">After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy.  </span><span id="en10339">He put his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand.  </span><span id="en10341">He seemed to have completely forgotten Zametov.  </span><span id="en10343">The silence lasted for some time. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10346">"Why don't you drink your tea?  </span><span id="en10348">It's getting cold," said Zametov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10351">"What!  </span><span id="en10353">Tea?  </span><span id="en10355">Oh, yes...."  </span><span id="en10357">Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together.  </span><span id="en10359">At the same moment his face resumed its original mocking expression.  </span><span id="en10361">He went on drinking tea. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10364">"There have been a great many of these crimes lately," said Zametov. " </span><span id="en10365">Only the other day I read in the  </span><i><span id="en10366">Moscow News </span></i><span id="en10367">  </span><span id="en10368">that a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in Moscow.  </span><span id="en10370">It was a regular society.  </span><span id="en10372">They used to forge tickets!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10376">"Oh, but it was a long time ago!  </span><span id="en10378">I read about it a month ago," Raskolnikov answered calmly. " </span><span id="en10380">So you consider them criminals?"  </span><span id="en10382">he added, smiling. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10385">"Of course they are criminals." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10388">"They?  </span><span id="en10390">They are children, simpletons, not criminals!  </span><span id="en10392">Why, half a hundred people meeting for such an object—what an idea!  </span><span id="en10394">Three would be too many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves!  </span><span id="en10396">One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.  </span><span id="en10398">Simpletons!  </span><span id="en10400">They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes—what a thing to trust to a casual stranger!  </span><span id="en10402">Well, let us suppose that these simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the rest of their lives?  </span><span id="en10404">Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his life!  </span><span id="en10406">Better hang oneself at once!  </span><span id="en10408">And they did not know how to change the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand roubles, and his hands trembled.  </span><span id="en10410">He counted the first four thousand, but did not count the fifth thousand—he was in such a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away.  </span><span id="en10412">Of course he roused suspicion.  </span><span id="en10414">And the whole thing came to a crash through one fool!  </span><span id="en10416">Is it possible?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10419">"That his hands trembled?"  </span><span id="en10421">observed Zametov, "yes, that's quite possible.  </span><span id="en10423">That, I feel quite sure, is possible.  </span><span id="en10425">Sometimes one can't stand things." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10428">"Can't stand that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10431">"Why, could you stand it then?  </span><span id="en10433">No, I couldn't.  </span><span id="en10435">For the sake of a hundred roubles to face such a terrible experience?  </span><span id="en10437">To go with false notes into a bank where it's their business to spot that sort of thing!  </span><span id="en10439">No, I should not have the face to do it.  </span><span id="en10441">Would you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10444">Raskolnikov had an intense desire again "to put his tongue out."  </span><span id="en10446">Shivers kept running down his spine. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10449">"I should do it quite differently," Raskolnikov began. " </span><span id="en10451">This is how I would change the notes: I'd count the first thousand three or four times backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I'd set to the second thousand; I'd count that half-way through and then hold some fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light again—to see whether it was a good one.  </span><span id="en10453">'I am afraid,' I would say, 'a relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a false note,' and then I'd tell them the whole story.  </span><span id="en10455">And after I began counting the third, 'No, excuse me,' I would say, 'I fancy I made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure. </span><span id="en10457">' And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and so on to the end.  </span><span id="en10459">And when I had finished, I'd pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again, 'Change them, please,' and put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how to get rid of me.  </span><span id="en10461">When I'd finished and had gone out, I'd come back, 'No, excuse me,' and ask for some explanation.  </span><span id="en10463">That's how I'd do it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10466">"Foo!  </span><span id="en10468">what terrible things you say!"  </span><span id="en10470">said Zametov, laughing. " </span><span id="en10472">But all that is only talk.  </span><span id="en10474">I dare say when it came to deeds you'd make a slip.  </span><span id="en10476">I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on himself, much less you and I.  </span><span id="en10478">To take an example near home—that old woman murdered in our district.  </span><span id="en10480">The murderer seems to have been a desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by a miracle—but his hands shook, too.  </span><span id="en10482">He did not succeed in robbing the place, he couldn't stand it.  </span><span id="en10484">That was clear from the..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10487">Raskolnikov seemed offended. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10490">"Clear?  </span><span id="en10492">Why don't you catch him then?"  </span><span id="en10494">he cried, maliciously gibing at Zametov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10497">"Well, they will catch him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10500">"Who?  </span><span id="en10502">You?  </span><span id="en10504">Do you suppose you could catch him?  </span><span id="en10506">You've a tough job!  </span><span id="en10508">A great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not.  </span><span id="en10510">If he had no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man.  </span><span id="en10512">So that any child can mislead you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10515">"The fact is they always do that, though," answered Zametov. " </span><span id="en10517">A man will commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes drinking in a tavern.  </span><span id="en10519">They are caught spending money, they are not all as cunning as you are.  </span><span id="en10521">You wouldn't go to a tavern, of course?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10524">Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10527">"You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should behave in that case, too?"  </span><span id="en10529">he asked with displeasure. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10532">"I should like to," Zametov answered firmly and seriously.  </span><span id="en10534">Somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10537">"Very much?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10540">"Very much!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10543">"All right then.  </span><span id="en10545">This is how I should behave," Raskolnikov began, again bringing his face close to Zametov's, again staring at him and speaking in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. " </span><span id="en10547">This is what I should have done.  </span><span id="en10549">I should have taken the money and jewels, I should have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden or place of that sort.  </span><span id="en10551">I should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house was built.  </span><span id="en10553">I would lift that stone—there would sure to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that hole.  </span><span id="en10555">Then I'd roll the stone back so that it would look as before, would press it down with my foot and walk away.  </span><span id="en10557">And for a year or two, three maybe, I would not touch it.  </span><span id="en10559">And, well, they could search!  </span><span id="en10561">There'd be no trace." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10564">"You are a madman," said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering.  </span><span id="en10566">He had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.  </span><span id="en10568">He bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move without uttering a word.  </span><span id="en10570">This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he was doing, but could not restrain himself.  </span><span id="en10572">The terrible word trembled on his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10575">"And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?"  </span><span id="en10577">he said suddenly and—realised what he had done. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10580">Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth.  </span><span id="en10582">His face wore a contorted smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10585">"But is it possible?"  </span><span id="en10587">he brought out faintly.  </span><span id="en10589">Raskolnikov looked wrathfully at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10592">"Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10595">"Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now," Zametov cried hastily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10598">"I've caught my cock-sparrow!  </span><span id="en10600">So you did believe it before, if now you believe less than ever?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10603">"Not at all," cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. " </span><span id="en10605">Have you been frightening me so as to lead up to this?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10608">"You don't believe it then?  </span><span id="en10610">What were you talking about behind my back when I went out of the police-office?  </span><span id="en10612">And why did the explosive lieutenant question me after I fainted?  </span><span id="en10614">Hey, there," he shouted to the waiter, getting up and taking his cap, "how much?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10617">"Thirty copecks," the latter replied, running up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10620">"And there is twenty copecks for vodka.  </span><span id="en10622">See what a lot of money!"  </span><span id="en10624">he held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. " </span><span id="en10626">Red notes and blue, twenty-five roubles.  </span><span id="en10628">Where did I get them?  </span><span id="en10630">And where did my new clothes come from?  </span><span id="en10632">You know I had not a copeck.  </span><span id="en10634">You've cross-examined my landlady, I'll be bound....  </span><span id="en10636">Well, that's enough!  </span><i><span id="en10639">Assez causé! </span></i><span id="en10641">  </span><span id="en10642">Till we meet again!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10648">He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture.  </span><span id="en10650">Yet he was gloomy and terribly tired.  </span><span id="en10652">His face was twisted as after a fit.  </span><span id="en10654">His fatigue increased rapidly.  </span><span id="en10656">Any shock, any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10659">Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in thought.  </span><span id="en10661">Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10664">"Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead," he decided. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10667">Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he stumbled against Razumihin on the steps.  </span><span id="en10669">They did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other.  </span><span id="en10671">For a moment they stood looking each other up and down.  </span><span id="en10673">Razumihin was greatly astounded, then anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10676">"So here you are!"  </span><span id="en10678">he shouted at the top of his voice—"you ran away from your bed!  </span><span id="en10680">And here I've been looking for you under the sofa!  </span><span id="en10682">We went up to the garret.  </span><span id="en10684">I almost beat Nastasya on your account.  </span><span id="en10686">And here he is after all.  </span><span id="en10688">Rodya!  </span><span id="en10690">What is the meaning of it?  </span><span id="en10692">Tell me the whole truth!  </span><span id="en10694">Confess!  </span><span id="en10696">Do you hear?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10699">"It means that I'm sick to death of you all and I want to be alone," Raskolnikov answered calmly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10702">"Alone?  </span><span id="en10704">When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath!  </span><span id="en10706">Idiot!...  </span><span id="en10708">What have you been doing in the Palais de Cristal?  </span><span id="en10710">Own up at once!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10713">"Let me go!"  </span><span id="en10715">said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him.  </span><span id="en10717">This was too much for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10720">"Let you go?  </span><span id="en10722">You dare tell me to let you go?  </span><span id="en10724">Do you know what I'll do with you directly?  </span><span id="en10726">I'll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you home under my arm and lock you up!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10729">"Listen, Razumihin," Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm—"can't you see that I don't want your benevolence?  </span><span id="en10731">A strange desire you have to shower benefits on a man who...  </span><span id="en10733">curses them, who feels them a burden in fact!  </span><span id="en10735">Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness?  </span><span id="en10737">Maybe I was very glad to die.  </span><span id="en10739">Didn't I tell you plainly enough to-day that you were torturing me, that I was...  </span><span id="en10741">sick of you!  </span><span id="en10743">You seem to want to torture people!  </span><span id="en10745">I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my recovery, because it's continually irritating me.  </span><span id="en10747">You saw Zossimov went away just now to avoid irritating me.  </span><span id="en10749">You leave me alone too, for goodness' sake!  </span><span id="en10751">What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force?  </span><span id="en10753">Don't you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now?  </span><span id="en10755">How, how can I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness?  </span><span id="en10757">I may be ungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God's sake, let me be!  </span><span id="en10759">Let me be, let me be!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10762">He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had been with Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10765">Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10768">"Well, go to hell then," he said gently and thoughtfully. " </span><span id="en10770">Stay," he roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. " </span><span id="en10772">Listen to me.  </span><span id="en10774">Let me tell you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots!  </span><span id="en10776">If you've any little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg.  </span><span id="en10778">And you are plagiarists even in that!  </span><span id="en10780">There isn't a sign of independent life in you!  </span><span id="en10782">You are made of spermaceti ointment and you've lymph in your veins instead of blood.  </span><span id="en10784">I don't believe in anyone of you!  </span><span id="en10786">In any circumstances the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being!  </span><span id="en10788">Stop!"  </span><span id="en10790">he cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making a movement—"hear me out!  </span><span id="en10792">You know I'm having a house-warming this evening, I dare say they've arrived by now, but I left my uncle there—I just ran in—to receive the guests.  </span><span id="en10794">And if you weren't a fool, a common fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...  </span><span id="en10796">you see, Rodya, I recognise you're a clever fellow, but you're a fool! </span><span id="en10798">—and if you weren't a fool you'd come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boots in the street!  </span><span id="en10800">Since you have gone out, there's no help for it!  </span><span id="en10802">I'd give you a snug easy chair, my landlady has one...  </span><span id="en10804">a cup of tea, company....  </span><span id="en10806">Or you could lie on the sofa—any way you would be with us....  </span><span id="en10808">Zossimov will be there too.  </span><span id="en10810">Will you come?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10813">"No." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10816">"R-rubbish!"  </span><span id="en10818">Razumihin shouted, out of patience. " </span><span id="en10820">How do you know?  </span><span id="en10822">You can't answer for yourself!  </span><span id="en10824">You don't know anything about it....  </span><span id="en10826">Thousands of times I've fought tooth and nail with people and run back to them afterwards....  </span><span id="en10828">One feels ashamed and goes back to a man!  </span><span id="en10830">So remember, Potchinkov's house on the third storey...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10833">"Why, Mr.  </span><span id="en10835">Razumihin, I do believe you'd let anybody beat you from sheer benevolence." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10838">"Beat?  </span><span id="en10840">Whom?  </span><span id="en10842">Me?  </span><span id="en10844">I'd twist his nose off at the mere idea!  </span><span id="en10846">Potchinkov's house, 47, Babushkin's flat...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10849">"I shall not come, Razumihin."  </span><span id="en10851">Raskolnikov turned and walked away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10854">"I bet you will," Razumihin shouted after him. " </span><span id="en10856">I refuse to know you if you don't!  </span><span id="en10858">Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10861">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10864">"Did you see him?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10867">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10870">"Talked to him?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10873">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10876">"What about?  </span><span id="en10878">Confound you, don't tell me then.  </span><span id="en10880">Potchinkov's house, 47, Babushkin's flat, remember!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10883">Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.  </span><span id="en10885">Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully.  </span><span id="en10887">Then with a wave of his hand he went into the house but stopped short of the stairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10890">"Confound it," he went on almost aloud. " </span><span id="en10892">He talked sensibly but yet...  </span><span id="en10894">I am a fool!  </span><span id="en10896">As if madmen didn't talk sensibly!  </span><span id="en10898">And this was just what Zossimov seemed afraid of."  </span><span id="en10900">He struck his finger on his forehead. " </span><span id="en10902">What if...  </span><span id="en10904">how could I let him go off alone?  </span><span id="en10906">He may drown himself....  </span><span id="en10908">Ach, what a blunder!  </span><span id="en10910">I can't."  </span><span id="en10912">And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but there was no trace of him.  </span><span id="en10914">With a curse he returned with rapid steps to the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10917">Raskolnikov walked straight to X—— Bridge, stood in the middle, and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance.  </span><span id="en10919">On parting with Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this place.  </span><span id="en10921">He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street.  </span><span id="en10923">Bending over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal, and the water seemed to catch his attention.  </span><span id="en10925">At last red circles flashed before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes.  </span><span id="en10927">Suddenly he started, saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight.  </span><span id="en10929">He became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow, wasted face and red sunken eyes.  </span><span id="en10931">She was looking straight at him, but obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one.  </span><span id="en10933">Suddenly she leaned her right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then her left and threw herself into the canal.  </span><span id="en10935">The filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10938">"A woman drowning!  </span><span id="en10940">A woman drowning!"  </span><span id="en10942">shouted dozens of voices; people ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10945">"Mercy on it!  </span><span id="en10947">it's our Afrosinya!"  </span><span id="en10949">a woman cried tearfully close by. " </span><span id="en10951">Mercy!  </span><span id="en10953">save her!  </span><span id="en10955">kind people, pull her out!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en10958">"A boat, a boat" was shouted in the crowd.  </span><span id="en10960">But there was no need of a boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into the water.  </span><span id="en10962">It was easy to reach her: she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once.  </span><span id="en10964">They laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment.  </span><span id="en10966">She soon recovered consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing, stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands.  </span><span id="en10968">She said nothing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en10971">"She's drunk herself out of her senses," the same woman's voice wailed at her side. " </span><span id="en10973">Out of her senses.  </span><span id="en10975">The other day she tried to hang herself, we cut her down.  </span><span id="en10977">I ran out to the shop just now, left my little girl to look after her—and here she's in trouble again!  </span><span id="en10979">A neighbour, gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end, see yonder...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en10982">The crowd broke up.  </span><span id="en10984">The police still remained round the woman, someone mentioned the police station....  </span><span id="en10986">Raskolnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and apathy.  </span><span id="en10988">He felt disgusted. " </span><span id="en10990">No, that's loathsome...  </span><span id="en10992">water...  </span><span id="en10994">it's not good enough," he muttered to himself. " </span><span id="en10996">Nothing will come of it," he added, "no use to wait.  </span><span id="en10998">What about the police office...?  </span><span id="en11000">And why isn't Zametov at the police office?  </span><span id="en11002">The police office is open till ten o'clock...."  </span><span id="en11004">He turned his back to the railing and looked about him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11007">"Very well then!"  </span><span id="en11009">he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office.  </span><span id="en11011">His heart felt hollow and empty.  </span><span id="en11013">He did not want to think.  </span><span id="en11015">Even his depression had passed, there was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out "to make an end of it all."  </span><span id="en11017">Complete apathy had succeeded to it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11020">"Well, it's a way out of it," he thought, walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank. " </span><span id="en11022">Anyway I'll make an end, for I want to....  </span><span id="en11024">But is it a way out?  </span><span id="en11026">What does it matter!  </span><span id="en11028">There'll be the square yard of space—ha!  </span><span id="en11030">But what an end!  </span><span id="en11032">Is it really the end?  </span><span id="en11034">Shall I tell them or not?  </span><span id="en11036">Ah...  </span><span id="en11038">damn!  </span><span id="en11040">How tired I am!  </span><span id="en11042">If I could find somewhere to sit or lie down soon!  </span><span id="en11044">What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid.  </span><span id="en11046">But I don't care about that either!  </span><span id="en11048">What idiotic ideas come into one's head." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11051">To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left.  </span><span id="en11053">It was only a few paces away.  </span><span id="en11055">But at the first turning he stopped and, after a minute's thought, turned into a side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time.  </span><span id="en11056">He walked, looking at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of  </span><i><span id="en11057">the </span></i><span id="en11058">  </span><span id="en11059">house.  </span><span id="en11060">He had not passed it, he had not been near it since  </span><i><span id="en11061">that </span></i><span id="en11062">  </span><span id="en11063">evening.  </span><span id="en11065">An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on.  </span><span id="en11067">He went into the house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.  </span><span id="en11069">The narrow, steep staircase was very dark.  </span><span id="en11071">He stopped at each landing and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out. " </span><span id="en11073">That wasn't so then," he thought.  </span><span id="en11075">Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been working. " </span><span id="en11077">It's shut up and the door newly painted.  </span><span id="en11079">So it's to let."  </span><span id="en11081">Then the third storey and the fourth. " </span><span id="en11083">Here!"  </span><span id="en11085">He was perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open.  </span><span id="en11087">There were men there, he could hear voices; he had not expected that.  </span><span id="en11089">After brief hesitation he mounted the last stairs and went into the flat.  </span><span id="en11091">It, too, was being done up; there were workmen in it.  </span><span id="en11093">This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the same places on the floor.  </span><span id="en11095">And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed strange.  </span><span id="en11097">He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill.  </span><span id="en11099">There were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the other.  </span><span id="en11101">They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one.  </span><span id="en11103">Raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly annoyed by this.  </span><span id="en11105">He looked at the new paper with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.  </span><span id="en11107">The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home.  </span><span id="en11109">They took no notice of Raskolnikov's coming in; they were talking.  </span><span id="en11111">Raskolnikov folded his arms and listened. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11116">"She comes to me in the morning," said the elder to the younger, "very early, all dressed up.  </span><span id="en11118">'Why are you preening and prinking? </span><span id="en11120">' says I.  </span><span id="en11122">'I am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch! </span><span id="en11124">' That's a way of going on!  </span><span id="en11126">And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11129">"And what is a fashion book?"  </span><span id="en11131">the younger one asked.  </span><span id="en11133">He obviously regarded the other as an authority. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11136">"A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the tailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how to dress, the male sex as well as the female.  </span><span id="en11138">They're pictures.  </span><span id="en11140">The gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies' fluffles, they're beyond anything you can fancy." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11143">"There's nothing you can't find in Petersburg," the younger cried enthusiastically, "except father and mother, there's everything!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11146">"Except them, there's everything to be found, my boy," the elder declared sententiously. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11149">Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box, the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very tiny without furniture in it.  </span><span id="en11151">The paper was the same; the paper in the corner showed where the case of ikons had stood.  </span><span id="en11153">He looked at it and went to the window.  </span><span id="en11155">The elder workman looked at him askance. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11158">"What do you want?"  </span><span id="en11160">he asked suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11163">Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell.  </span><span id="en11165">The same bell, the same cracked note.  </span><span id="en11167">He rang it a second and a third time; he listened and remembered.  </span><span id="en11169">The hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more vividly.  </span><span id="en11171">He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more satisfaction. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11174">"Well, what do you want?  </span><span id="en11176">Who are you?"  </span><span id="en11178">the workman shouted, going out to him.  </span><span id="en11180">Raskolnikov went inside again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11183">"I want to take a flat," he said. " </span><span id="en11185">I am looking round." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11188">"It's not the time to look at rooms at night!  </span><span id="en11190">and you ought to come up with the porter." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11193">"The floors have been washed, will they be painted?"  </span><span id="en11195">Raskolnikov went on. " </span><span id="en11197">Is there no blood?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11200">"What blood?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11203">"Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here.  </span><span id="en11205">There was a perfect pool there." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11208">"But who are you?"  </span><span id="en11210">the workman cried, uneasy. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11213">"Who am I?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11216">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11219">"You want to know?  </span><span id="en11221">Come to the police station, I'll tell you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11224">The workmen looked at him in amazement. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11227">"It's time for us to go, we are late.  </span><span id="en11229">Come along, Alyoshka.  </span><span id="en11231">We must lock up," said the elder workman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11234">"Very well, come along," said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going out first, he went slowly downstairs. " </span><span id="en11236">Hey, porter," he cried in the gateway. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11239">At the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by; the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.  </span><span id="en11241">Raskolnikov went straight up to them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11244">"What do you want?"  </span><span id="en11246">asked one of the porters. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11249">"Have you been to the police office?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11252">"I've just been there.  </span><span id="en11254">What do you want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11257">"Is it open?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11260">"Of course." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11263">"Is the assistant there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11266">"He was there for a time.  </span><span id="en11268">What do you want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11271">Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11274">"He's been to look at the flat," said the elder workman, coming forward. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11277">"Which flat?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11280">"Where we are at work.  </span><span id="en11282">'Why have you washed away the blood? </span><span id="en11284">' says he.  </span><span id="en11286">'There has been a murder here,' says he, 'and I've come to take it. </span><span id="en11288">' And he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it.  </span><span id="en11290">'Come to the police station,' says he.  </span><span id="en11292">'I'll tell you everything there. </span><span id="en11294">' He wouldn't leave us." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11297">The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11300">"Who are you?"  </span><span id="en11302">he shouted as impressively as he could. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11305">"I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in Shil's house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he knows me."  </span><span id="en11307">Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11310">"Why have you been to the flat?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11313">"To look at it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11316">"What is there to look at?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11319">"Take him straight to the police station," the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11321">Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the same slow, lazy tones: </span></p>
<p><span id="en11323">"Come along." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11326">"Yes, take him," the man went on more confidently. " </span><span id="en11327">Why was he going into  </span><i><span id="en11328">that </span></i><span id="en11330">, what's in his mind, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11334">"He's not drunk, but God knows what's the matter with him," muttered the workman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11337">"But what do you want?"  </span><span id="en11339">the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry in earnest—"Why are you hanging about?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11342">"You funk the police station then?"  </span><span id="en11344">said Raskolnikov jeeringly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11347">"How funk it?  </span><span id="en11349">Why are you hanging about?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11352">"He's a rogue!"  </span><span id="en11354">shouted the peasant woman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11357">"Why waste time talking to him?"  </span><span id="en11359">cried the other porter, a huge peasant in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. " </span><span id="en11361">Get along!  </span><span id="en11363">He is a rogue and no mistake.  </span><span id="en11365">Get along!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11368">And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street.  </span><span id="en11370">He lurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in silence and walked away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11373">"Strange man!"  </span><span id="en11375">observed the workman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11378">"There are strange folks about nowadays," said the woman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11381">"You should have taken him to the police station all the same," said the man in the long coat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11384">"Better have nothing to do with him," decided the big porter. " </span><span id="en11386">A regular rogue!  </span><span id="en11388">Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you won't get rid of him....  </span><span id="en11390">We know the sort!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11393">"Shall I go there or not?"  </span><span id="en11395">thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as though expecting from someone a decisive word.  </span><span id="en11397">But no sound came, all was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to him alone....  </span><span id="en11399">All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.  </span><span id="en11401">In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage....  </span><span id="en11403">A light gleamed in the middle of the street. " </span><span id="en11405">What is it?"  </span><span id="en11407">Raskolnikov turned to the right and went up to the crowd.  </span><span id="en11409">He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to the police station and knew that it would all soon be over. </span></p>

<p><span id="en11413">An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....  </span><span id="en11415">A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front.  </span><span id="en11417">One of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying close to the wheels.  </span><span id="en11418">Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating: </span></p>
<p><span id="en11420">"What a misfortune!  </span><span id="en11422">Good Lord, what a misfortune!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11425">Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest.  </span><span id="en11427">On the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman.  </span><span id="en11429">Blood was flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and disfigured.  </span><span id="en11431">He was evidently badly injured. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11434">"Merciful heaven!"  </span><span id="en11436">wailed the coachman, "what more could I do?  </span><span id="en11438">If I'd been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly, not in a hurry.  </span><span id="en11440">Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody else.  </span><span id="en11442">A drunken man can't walk straight, we all know....  </span><span id="en11444">I saw him crossing the street, staggering and almost falling.  </span><span id="en11446">I shouted again and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell straight under their feet!  </span><span id="en11448">Either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy....  </span><span id="en11450">The horses are young and ready to take fright...  </span><span id="en11452">they started, he screamed...  </span><span id="en11454">that made them worse.  </span><span id="en11456">That's how it happened!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11459">"That's just how it was," a voice in the crowd confirmed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11462">"He shouted, that's true, he shouted three times," another voice declared. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11465">"Three times it was, we all heard it," shouted a third. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11468">But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened.  </span><span id="en11470">It was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements.  </span><span id="en11472">All they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital.  </span><span id="en11474">No one knew his name. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11477">Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him.  </span><span id="en11479">The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man's face.  </span><span id="en11481">He recognised him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11484">"I know him!  </span><span id="en11486">I know him!"  </span><span id="en11488">he shouted, pushing to the front. " </span><span id="en11490">It's a government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov.  </span><span id="en11492">He lives close by in Kozel's house....  </span><span id="en11494">Make haste for a doctor!  </span><span id="en11496">I will pay, see?"  </span><span id="en11498">He pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman.  </span><span id="en11500">He was in violent agitation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11503">The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.  </span><span id="en11505">Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at once. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11508">"Just here, three houses away," he said eagerly, "the house belongs to Kozel, a rich German.  </span><span id="en11510">He was going home, no doubt drunk.  </span><span id="en11512">I know him, he is a drunkard.  </span><span id="en11514">He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one daughter....  </span><span id="en11516">It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is sure to be a doctor in the house.  </span><span id="en11518">I'll pay, I'll pay!  </span><span id="en11520">At least he will be looked after at home...  </span><span id="en11522">they will help him at once.  </span><span id="en11524">But he'll die before you get him to the hospital."  </span><span id="en11526">He managed to slip something unseen into the policeman's hand.  </span><span id="en11528">But the thing was straightforward and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here.  </span><span id="en11530">They raised the injured man; people volunteered to help. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11533">Kozel's house was thirty yards away.  </span><span id="en11535">Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully holding Marmeladov's head and showing the way. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11538">"This way, this way!  </span><span id="en11540">We must take him upstairs head foremost.  </span><span id="en11542">Turn round!  </span><span id="en11544">I'll pay, I'll make it worth your while," he muttered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11547">Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself and coughing.  </span><span id="en11549">Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand.  </span><span id="en11551">This time Polenka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed.  </span><span id="en11553">The boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.  </span><span id="en11555">He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him—heels together and toes turned out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11558">He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed.  </span><span id="en11560">A little girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn.  </span><span id="en11562">The door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor, consumptive woman.  </span><span id="en11564">Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11567">"You wouldn't believe, you can't imagine, Polenka," she said, walking about the room, "what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa's house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!  </span><span id="en11569">Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that everyone who came to see him said, 'We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch, as our governor! </span><span id="en11571">' When I...  </span><span id="en11573">when..."  </span><span id="en11575">she coughed violently, "oh, cursed life," she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast, "when I...  </span><span id="en11577">when at the last ball...  </span><span id="en11579">at the marshal's...  </span><span id="en11581">Princess Bezzemelny saw me—who gave me the blessing when your father and I were married, Polenka—she asked at once 'Isn't that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up? </span><span id="en11583">' (You must mend that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or to-morrow—cough, cough, cough—he will make the hole bigger," she articulated with effort. </span><span id="en11585">) "Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just come from Petersburg then...  </span><span id="en11587">he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions and told him that my heart had long been another's.  </span><span id="en11589">That other was your father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry....  </span><span id="en11591">Is the water ready?  </span><span id="en11593">Give me the shirt, and the stockings!  </span><span id="en11595">Lida," said she to the youngest one, "you must manage without your chemise to-night...  </span><span id="en11597">and lay your stockings out with it...  </span><span id="en11599">I'll wash them together....  </span><span id="en11601">How is it that drunken vagabond doesn't come in?  </span><span id="en11603">He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout, he has torn it to rags!  </span><span id="en11605">I'd do it all together, so as not to have to work two nights running!  </span><span id="en11607">Oh, dear!  </span><span id="en11609">(Cough, cough, cough, cough! </span><span id="en11611">) Again!  </span><span id="en11613">What's this?"  </span><span id="en11615">she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men, who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. " </span><span id="en11617">What is it?  </span><span id="en11619">What are they bringing?  </span><span id="en11621">Mercy on us!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11624">"Where are we to put him?"  </span><span id="en11626">asked the policeman, looking round when Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11629">"On the sofa!  </span><span id="en11631">Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way," Raskolnikov showed him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11634">"Run over in the road!  </span><span id="en11636">Drunk!"  </span><span id="en11638">someone shouted in the passage. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11641">Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath.  </span><span id="en11643">The children were terrified.  </span><span id="en11645">Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and clutched at her, trembling all over. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11648">Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11651">"For God's sake be calm, don't be frightened!"  </span><span id="en11653">he said, speaking quickly, "he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don't be frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here...  </span><span id="en11655">I've been here already, you remember?  </span><span id="en11657">He will come to; I'll pay!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11660">"He's done it this time!"  </span><span id="en11662">Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she rushed to her husband. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11665">Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who swoon easily.  </span><span id="en11667">She instantly placed under the luckless man's head a pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him.  </span><span id="en11669">She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11672">Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor.  </span><span id="en11674">There was a doctor, it appeared, next door but one. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11677">"I've sent for a doctor," he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, "don't be uneasy, I'll pay.  </span><span id="en11679">Haven't you water?...  </span><span id="en11681">and give me a napkin or a towel, anything, as quick as you can....  </span><span id="en11683">He is injured, but not killed, believe me....  </span><span id="en11685">We shall see what the doctor says!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11688">Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in readiness for washing her children's and husband's linen that night.  </span><span id="en11690">This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a week, if not oftener.  </span><span id="en11692">For the family had come to such a pass that they were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry by the morning.  </span><span id="en11694">She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov's request, but almost fell down with her burden.  </span><span id="en11696">But the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off Marmeladov's face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11699">Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands to her breast.  </span><span id="en11701">She was in need of attention herself.  </span><span id="en11703">Raskolnikov began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here.  </span><span id="en11705">The policeman, too, stood in hesitation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11708">"Polenka," cried Katerina Ivanovna, "run to Sonia, make haste.  </span><span id="en11710">If you don't find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over and that she is to come here at once...  </span><span id="en11712">when she comes in.  </span><span id="en11714">Run, Polenka!  </span><span id="en11716">there, put on the shawl." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11719">"Run your fastest!"  </span><span id="en11721">cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his heels thrust forward and his toes spread out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11724">Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn't have dropped a pin.  </span><span id="en11726">The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs.  </span><span id="en11728">Almost all Madame Lippevechsel's lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but afterwards they overflowed into the room.  </span><span id="en11730">Katerina Ivanovna flew into a fury. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11733">"You might let him die in peace, at least," she shouted at the crowd, "is it a spectacle for you to gape at?  </span><span id="en11735">With cigarettes!  </span><span id="en11737">(Cough, cough, cough! </span><span id="en11739">) You might as well keep your hats on....  </span><span id="en11741">And there is one in his hat!...  </span><span id="en11743">Get away!  </span><span id="en11745">You should respect the dead, at least!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11748">Her cough choked her—but her reproaches were not without result.  </span><span id="en11750">They evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna.  </span><span id="en11752">The lodgers, one after another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11755">Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying that they'd no business to make a disturbance here. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11758">"No business to die!"  </span><span id="en11760">cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident and ran in to restore order.  </span><span id="en11762">She was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible German. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11765">"Ah, my God!"  </span><span id="en11767">she cried, clasping her hands, "your husband drunken horses have trampled!  </span><span id="en11769">To the hospital with him!  </span><span id="en11771">I am the landlady!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11774">"Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying," Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with the landlady that she might "remember her place" and even now could not deny herself this satisfaction). " </span><span id="en11776">Amalia Ludwigovna..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11779">"I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11782">"You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not one of your despicable flatterers like Mr.  </span><span id="en11784">Lebeziatnikov, who's laughing behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of 'they are at it again' was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you Amalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that name.  </span><span id="en11786">You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch; he is dying.  </span><span id="en11788">I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.  </span><span id="en11790">Let him at least die in peace!  </span><span id="en11792">Or I warn you the Governor-General, himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow.  </span><span id="en11794">The prince knew me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been a benefactor to him.  </span><span id="en11796">Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a child.  </span><span id="en11798">You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11801">All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker, but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna's eloquence.  </span><span id="en11803">At that instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she ran to him.  </span><span id="en11805">The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him.  </span><span id="en11807">He drew deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead.  </span><span id="en11809">Not recognising Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily.  </span><span id="en11811">Katerina Ivanovna looked at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11814">"My God!  </span><span id="en11816">His whole chest is crushed!  </span><span id="en11818">How he is bleeding," she said in despair. " </span><span id="en11820">We must take off his clothes.  </span><span id="en11822">Turn a little, Semyon Zaharovitch, if you can," she cried to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11825">Marmeladov recognised her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11828">"A priest," he articulated huskily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11830">Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window frame and exclaimed in despair: </span></p>
<p><span id="en11832">"Oh, cursed life!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11835">"A priest," the dying man said again after a moment's silence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11838">"They've gone for him," Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her shout and was silent.  </span><span id="en11840">With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she returned and stood by his pillow.  </span><span id="en11842">He seemed a little easier but not for long. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11845">Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her wondering childish eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11848">"A-ah," he signed towards her uneasily.  </span><span id="en11850">He wanted to say something. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11853">"What now?"  </span><span id="en11855">cried Katerina Ivanovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11858">"Barefoot, barefoot!"  </span><span id="en11860">he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the child's bare feet. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11863">"Be silent," Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, "you know why she is barefooted." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11866">"Thank God, the doctor," exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11869">The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man's chest.  </span><span id="en11871">It was gashed, crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.  </span><span id="en11873">On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking yellowish-black bruise—a cruel kick from the horse's hoof.  </span><span id="en11875">The doctor frowned.  </span><span id="en11877">The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11880">"It's wonderful that he has recovered consciousness," the doctor whispered softly to Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11883">"What do you think of him?"  </span><span id="en11885">he asked. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11888">"He will die immediately." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11891">"Is there really no hope?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en11894">"Not the faintest!  </span><span id="en11896">He is at the last gasp....  </span><span id="en11898">His head is badly injured, too...  </span><span id="en11900">Hm...  </span><span id="en11902">I could bleed him if you like, but...  </span><span id="en11904">it would be useless.  </span><span id="en11906">He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11909">"Better bleed him then." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11912">"If you like....  </span><span id="en11914">But I warn you it will be perfectly useless." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11917">At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted, and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament.  </span><span id="en11919">A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.  </span><span id="en11921">The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.  </span><span id="en11923">Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while.  </span><span id="en11925">He shrugged his shoulders and remained. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11928">All stepped back.  </span><span id="en11930">The confession was soon over.  </span><span id="en11932">The dying man probably understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.  </span><span id="en11934">Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of her.  </span><span id="en11936">The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which seemed to afford him especial satisfaction.  </span><span id="en11938">Katerina Ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling straight the boy's shirt, and managed to cover the girl's bare shoulders with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her knees or ceasing to pray.  </span><span id="en11940">Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again.  </span><span id="en11942">In the passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not venture beyond the threshold.  </span><span id="en11944">A single candle-end lighted up the scene. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11947">At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door.  </span><span id="en11949">She came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for her mother, went up to her and said, "She's coming, I met her in the street."  </span><span id="en11951">Her mother made her kneel beside her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11954">Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd, and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags, death and despair.  </span><span id="en11956">She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp, unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose.  </span><span id="en11958">Sonia stopped short in the doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.  </span><span id="en11960">She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat with its flaring flame-coloured feather.  </span><span id="en11962">Under this rakishly-tilted hat was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in terror.  </span><span id="en11964">Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather pretty, with wonderful blue eyes.  </span><span id="en11966">She looked intently at the bed and the priest; she too was out of breath with running.  </span><span id="en11968">At last whispers, some words in the crowd probably, reached her.  </span><span id="en11970">She looked down and took a step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11973">The service was over.  </span><span id="en11975">Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.  </span><span id="en11977">The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11980">"What am I to do with these?"  </span><span id="en11982">she interrupted sharply and irritably, pointing to the little ones. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11985">"God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour," the priest began. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11988">"Ach!  </span><span id="en11990">He is merciful, but not to us." </span></p>
<p><span id="en11993">"That's a sin, a sin, madam," observed the priest, shaking his head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en11996">"And isn't that a sin?"  </span><span id="en11998">cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying man. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12001">"Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12004">"You don't understand!"  </span><span id="en12006">cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand. " </span><span id="en12008">And why should they compensate me?  </span><span id="en12010">Why, he was drunk and threw himself under the horses!  </span><span id="en12012">What earnings?  </span><span id="en12014">He brought us in nothing but misery.  </span><span id="en12016">He drank everything away, the drunkard!  </span><span id="en12018">He robbed us to get drink, he wasted their lives and mine for drink!  </span><span id="en12020">And thank God he's dying!  </span><span id="en12022">One less to keep!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12025">"You must forgive in the hour of death, that's a sin, madam, such feelings are a great sin." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12028">Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water, wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight, and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest.  </span><span id="en12030">Now she flew at him almost in a frenzy. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12033">"Ah, father!  </span><span id="en12035">That's words and only words!  </span><span id="en12037">Forgive!  </span><span id="en12039">If he'd not been run over, he'd have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and in rags and he'd have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children's and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I should have been darning them.  </span><span id="en12041">That's how I spend my nights!...  </span><span id="en12043">What's the use of talking of forgiveness!  </span><span id="en12045">I have forgiven as it is!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12048">A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words.  </span><span id="en12050">She put her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her aching chest.  </span><span id="en12052">The handkerchief was covered with blood.  </span><span id="en12054">The priest bowed his head and said nothing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12057">Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again.  </span><span id="en12058">He kept trying to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him: </span></p>
<p><span id="en12060">"Be silent!  </span><span id="en12062">No need!  </span><span id="en12064">I know what you want to say!"  </span><span id="en12066">And the sick man was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the doorway and he saw Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12069">Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a corner. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12072">"Who's that?  </span><span id="en12074">Who's that?"  </span><span id="en12076">he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice, in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his daughter was standing, and trying to sit up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12079">"Lie down!  </span><span id="en12081">Lie do-own!"  </span><span id="en12083">cried Katerina Ivanovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12086">With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his elbow.  </span><span id="en12088">He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as though not recognising her.  </span><span id="en12090">He had never seen her before in such attire.  </span><span id="en12092">Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying father.  </span><span id="en12094">His face showed intense suffering. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12097">"Sonia!  </span><span id="en12099">Daughter!  </span><span id="en12101">Forgive!"  </span><span id="en12103">he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on the floor.  </span><span id="en12105">They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he was dying.  </span><span id="en12107">Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so without moving.  </span><span id="en12109">He died in her arms. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12112">"He's got what he wanted," Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband's dead body. " </span><span id="en12114">Well, what's to be done now?  </span><span id="en12116">How am I to bury him!  </span><span id="en12118">What can I give them to-morrow to eat?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12121">Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12124">"Katerina Ivanovna," he began, "last week your husband told me all his life and circumstances....  </span><span id="en12126">Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate reverence.  </span><span id="en12128">From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna, in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became friends....  </span><span id="en12130">Allow me now...  </span><span id="en12132">to do something...  </span><span id="en12134">to repay my debt to my dead friend.  </span><span id="en12136">Here are twenty roubles, I think—and if that can be of any assistance to you, then...  </span><span id="en12138">I...  </span><span id="en12140">in short, I will come again, I will be sure to come again...  </span><span id="en12142">I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....  </span><span id="en12144">Good-bye!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12147">And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd to the stairs.  </span><span id="en12149">But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions in person.  </span><span id="en12151">They had not met since the scene at the police station, but Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12154">"Ah, is that you?"  </span><span id="en12156">he asked him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12159">"He's dead," answered Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en12161">The doctor and the priest have been, all as it should have been.  </span><span id="en12163">Don't worry the poor woman too much, she is in consumption as it is.  </span><span id="en12165">Try and cheer her up, if possible...  </span><span id="en12167">you are a kind-hearted man, I know..."  </span><span id="en12169">he added with a smile, looking straight in his face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12172">"But you are spattered with blood," observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov's waistcoat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12175">"Yes...  </span><span id="en12177">I'm covered with blood," Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air; then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12180">He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him.  </span><span id="en12182">This sensation might be compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned.  </span><span id="en12184">Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting with him.  </span><span id="en12186">He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him.  </span><span id="en12188">Someone overtook him; it was Polenka.  </span><span id="en12190">She was running after him, calling "Wait!  </span><span id="en12192">wait!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12195">He turned round.  </span><span id="en12197">She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him.  </span><span id="en12199">A dim light came in from the yard.  </span><span id="en12201">Raskolnikov could distinguish the child's thin but pretty little face, looking at him with a bright childish smile.  </span><span id="en12203">She had run after him with a message which she was evidently glad to give. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12206">"Tell me, what is your name?...  </span><span id="en12208">and where do you live?"  </span><span id="en12210">she said hurriedly in a breathless voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12213">He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of rapture.  </span><span id="en12215">It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said why. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12218">"Who sent you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12221">"Sister Sonia sent me," answered the girl, smiling still more brightly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12224">"I knew it was sister Sonia sent you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12227">"Mamma sent me, too...  </span><span id="en12229">when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up, too, and said 'Run fast, Polenka. </span><span id="en12230">'" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12232">"Do you love sister Sonia?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12235">"I love her more than anyone," Polenka answered with a peculiar earnestness, and her smile became graver. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12238">"And will you love me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12241">By way of answer he saw the little girl's face approaching him, her full lips naïvely held out to kiss him.  </span><span id="en12243">Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl wept softly, pressing her face against him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12246">"I am sorry for father," she said a moment later, raising her tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. " </span><span id="en12248">It's nothing but misfortunes now," she added suddenly with that peculiarly sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak like grown-up people. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12251">"Did your father love you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12254">"He loved Lida most," she went on very seriously without a smile, exactly like grown-up people, "he loved her because she is little and because she is ill, too.  </span><span id="en12256">And he always used to bring her presents.  </span><span id="en12258">But he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too," she added with dignity. " </span><span id="en12260">And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she liked it and father knew it, too.  </span><span id="en12262">And mother wants to teach me French, for it's time my education began." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12265">"And do you know your prayers?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12268">"Of course, we do!  </span><span id="en12270">We knew them long ago.  </span><span id="en12272">I say my prayers to myself as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.  </span><span id="en12274">First they repeat the 'Ave Maria' and then another prayer: 'Lord, forgive and bless sister Sonia,' and then another, 'Lord, forgive and bless our second father. </span><span id="en12276">' For our elder father is dead and this is another one, but we do pray for the other as well." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12279">"Polenka, my name is Rodion.  </span><span id="en12281">Pray sometimes for me, too.  </span><span id="en12283">'And Thy servant Rodion,' nothing more." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12286">"I'll pray for you all the rest of my life," the little girl declared hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him warmly once more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12289">Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to come next day.  </span><span id="en12291">The child went away quite enchanted with him.  </span><span id="en12293">It was past ten when he came out into the street.  </span><span id="en12295">In five minutes he was standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12298">"Enough," he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. " </span><span id="en12300">I've done with fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms!  </span><span id="en12302">Life is real!  </span><span id="en12304">haven't I lived just now?  </span><span id="en12306">My life has not yet died with that old woman!  </span><span id="en12308">The Kingdom of Heaven to her—and now enough, madam, leave me in peace!  </span><span id="en12310">Now for the reign of reason and light...  </span><span id="en12312">and of will, and of strength...  </span><span id="en12314">and now we will see!  </span><span id="en12316">We will try our strength!"  </span><span id="en12318">he added defiantly, as though challenging some power of darkness. " </span><span id="en12320">And I was ready to consent to live in a square of space! </span></p>
<p><span id="en12323">"I am very weak at this moment, but...  </span><span id="en12325">I believe my illness is all over.  </span><span id="en12327">I knew it would be over when I went out.  </span><span id="en12329">By the way, Potchinkov's house is only a few steps away.  </span><span id="en12331">I certainly must go to Razumihin even if it were not close by...  </span><span id="en12333">let him win his bet!  </span><span id="en12335">Let us give him some satisfaction, too—no matter!  </span><span id="en12337">Strength, strength is what one wants, you can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength—that's what they don't know," he added proudly and self-confidently and he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge.  </span><span id="en12339">Pride and self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming a different man every moment.  </span><span id="en12341">What was it had happened to work this revolution in him?  </span><span id="en12343">He did not know himself; like a man catching at a straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, 'could live, that there was still life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman. </span><span id="en12345">' Perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of that. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12348">"But I did ask her to remember 'Thy servant Rodion' in her prayers," the idea struck him. " </span><span id="en12350">Well, that was...  </span><span id="en12352">in case of emergency," he added and laughed himself at his boyish sally.  </span><span id="en12354">He was in the best of spirits. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12357">He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at Potchinkov's and the porter at once showed him the way.  </span><span id="en12359">Half-way upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big gathering of people.  </span><span id="en12361">The door was wide open on the stairs; he could hear exclamations and discussion.  </span><span id="en12363">Razumihin's room was fairly large; the company consisted of fifteen people.  </span><span id="en12365">Raskolnikov stopped in the entry, where two of the landlady's servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up from the landlady's kitchen.  </span><span id="en12367">Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin.  </span><span id="en12369">He ran out delighted.  </span><span id="en12371">At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12374">"Listen," Raskolnikov hastened to say, "I've only just come to tell you you've won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to him.  </span><span id="en12376">I can't come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly.  </span><span id="en12378">And so good evening and good-bye!  </span><span id="en12380">Come and see me to-morrow." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12383">"Do you know what?  </span><span id="en12385">I'll see you home.  </span><span id="en12387">If you say you're weak yourself, you must..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12390">"And your visitors?  </span><span id="en12392">Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped out?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12395">"He?  </span><span id="en12397">Goodness only knows!  </span><span id="en12399">Some friend of uncle's, I expect, or perhaps he has come without being invited...  </span><span id="en12401">I'll leave uncle with them, he is an invaluable person, pity I can't introduce you to him now.  </span><span id="en12403">But confound them all now!  </span><span id="en12405">They won't notice me, and I need a little fresh air, for you've come just in the nick of time—another two minutes and I should have come to blows!  </span><span id="en12407">They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...  </span><span id="en12409">you simply can't imagine what men will say!  </span><span id="en12411">Though why shouldn't you imagine?  </span><span id="en12413">Don't we talk nonsense ourselves?  </span><span id="en12415">And let them...  </span><span id="en12417">that's the way to learn not to!...  </span><span id="en12419">Wait a minute, I'll fetch Zossimov." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12422">Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special interest in him; soon his face brightened. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12425">"You must go to bed at once," he pronounced, examining the patient as far as he could, "and take something for the night.  </span><span id="en12427">Will you take it?  </span><span id="en12429">I got it ready some time ago...  </span><span id="en12431">a powder." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12434">"Two, if you like," answered Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en12436">The powder was taken at once. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12439">"It's a good thing you are taking him home," observed Zossimov to Razumihin—"we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he's not at all amiss—a considerable change since the afternoon.  </span><span id="en12441">Live and learn..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12444">"Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?"  </span><span id="en12446">Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. " </span><span id="en12448">I won't tell you everything, brother, because they are such fools.  </span><span id="en12450">Zossimov told me to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he's got a notion in his head that you are...  </span><span id="en12452">mad or close on it.  </span><span id="en12454">Only fancy!  </span><span id="en12456">In the first place, you've three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad, you needn't care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly, that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental diseases, and what's brought him to this conclusion about you was your conversation to-day with Zametov." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12459">"Zametov told you all about it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12462">"Yes, and he did well.  </span><span id="en12464">Now I understand what it all means and so does Zametov....  </span><span id="en12466">Well, the fact is, Rodya...  </span><span id="en12468">the point is...  </span><span id="en12470">I am a little drunk now....  </span><span id="en12472">But that's...  </span><span id="en12474">no matter...  </span><span id="en12476">the point is that this idea...  </span><span id="en12478">you understand?  </span><span id="en12480">was just being hatched in their brains...  </span><span id="en12482">you understand?  </span><span id="en12484">That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that bubble's burst and gone for ever.  </span><span id="en12486">But why are they such fools?  </span><span id="en12488">I gave Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time—that's between ourselves, brother; please don't let out a hint that you know of it; I've noticed he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna's.  </span><span id="en12490">But to-day, to-day it's all cleared up.  </span><span id="en12492">That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it!  </span><span id="en12494">He took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed of it himself now; I know that..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12497">Raskolnikov listened greedily.  </span><span id="en12499">Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too freely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12502">"I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint," said Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12505">"No need to explain that!  </span><span id="en12507">And it wasn't the paint only: the fever had been coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that!  </span><span id="en12509">But how crushed that boy is now, you wouldn't believe!  </span><span id="en12511">'I am not worth his little finger,' he says.  </span><span id="en12513">Yours, he means.  </span><span id="en12515">He has good feelings at times, brother.  </span><span id="en12517">But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais de Cristal, that was too good for anything!  </span><span id="en12519">You frightened him at first, you know, he nearly went into convulsions!  </span><span id="en12521">You almost convinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you suddenly—put out your tongue at him: 'There now, what do you make of it? </span><span id="en12523">' It was perfect!  </span><span id="en12525">He is crushed, annihilated now!  </span><span id="en12527">It was masterly, by Jove, it's what they deserve!  </span><span id="en12529">Ah, that I wasn't there!  </span><span id="en12531">He was hoping to see you awfully.  </span><span id="en12533">Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12536">"Ah!...  </span><span id="en12538">he too...  </span><span id="en12540">but why did they put me down as mad?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12543">"Oh, not mad.  </span><span id="en12545">I must have said too much, brother....  </span><span id="en12547">What struck him, you see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it's clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances...  </span><span id="en12549">and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness...  </span><span id="en12551">I am a little drunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own...  </span><span id="en12553">I tell you, he's mad on mental diseases.  </span><span id="en12555">But don't you mind him..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12558">For half a minute both were silent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12561">"Listen, Razumihin," began Raskolnikov, "I want to tell you plainly: I've just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died...  </span><span id="en12563">I gave them all my money...  </span><span id="en12565">and besides I've just been kissed by someone who, if I had killed anyone, would just the same...  </span><span id="en12567">in fact I saw someone else there...  </span><span id="en12569">with a flame-coloured feather...  </span><span id="en12571">but I am talking nonsense; I am very weak, support me...  </span><span id="en12573">we shall be at the stairs directly..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12576">"What's the matter?  </span><span id="en12578">What's the matter with you?"  </span><span id="en12580">Razumihin asked anxiously. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12583">"I am a little giddy, but that's not the point, I am so sad, so sad...  </span><span id="en12585">like a woman.  </span><span id="en12587">Look, what's that?  </span><span id="en12589">Look, look!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12592">"What is it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12595">"Don't you see?  </span><span id="en12597">A light in my room, you see?  </span><span id="en12599">Through the crack..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12602">They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level of the landlady's door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that there was a light in Raskolnikov's garret. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12605">"Queer!  </span><span id="en12607">Nastasya, perhaps," observed Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12610">"She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago, but...  </span><span id="en12612">I don't care!  </span><span id="en12614">Good-bye!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12617">"What do you mean?  </span><span id="en12619">I am coming with you, we'll come in together!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12622">"I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say good-bye to you here.  </span><span id="en12624">So give me your hand, good-bye!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12627">"What's the matter with you, Rodya?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12630">"Nothing...  </span><span id="en12632">come along...  </span><span id="en12634">you shall be witness." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12637">They began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that perhaps Zossimov might be right after all. " </span><span id="en12639">Ah, I've upset him with my chatter!"  </span><span id="en12641">he muttered to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12644">When they reached the door they heard voices in the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12647">"What is it?"  </span><span id="en12649">cried Razumihin.  </span><span id="en12651">Raskolnikov was the first to open the door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12654">His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him.  </span><span id="en12656">Why had he never expected, never thought of them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would arrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day?  </span><span id="en12658">They had spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions.  </span><span id="en12660">She was standing before them and had told them everything by now.  </span><span id="en12662">They were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his "running away" to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! " </span><span id="en12664">Good Heavens, what had become of him?"  </span><span id="en12666">Both had been weeping, both had been in anguish for that hour and a half. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12669">A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov's entrance.  </span><span id="en12671">Both rushed to him.  </span><span id="en12673">But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck him like a thunderbolt.  </span><span id="en12675">He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he could not.  </span><span id="en12677">His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him, laughed and cried.  </span><span id="en12679">He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground, fainting. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12682">Anxiety, cries of horror, moans...  </span><span id="en12684">Razumihin who was standing in the doorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and in a moment had him on the sofa. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12687">"It's nothing, nothing!"  </span><span id="en12689">he cried to the mother and sister—"it's only a faint, a mere trifle!  </span><span id="en12691">Only just now the doctor said he was much better, that he is perfectly well!  </span><span id="en12693">Water!  </span><span id="en12695">See, he is coming to himself, he is all right again!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12698">And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made her bend down to see that "he is all right again."  </span><span id="en12700">The mother and sister looked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence.  </span><span id="en12702">They had heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya during his illness, by this "very competent young man," as Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with Dounia. </span></p>

<p><span id="en12707">Raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa.  </span><span id="en12709">He waved his hand weakly to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.  </span><span id="en12711">His mother was alarmed by his expression.  </span><span id="en12713">It revealed an emotion agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost insane.  </span><span id="en12715">Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12718">Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother's. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12721">"Go home...  </span><span id="en12723">with him," he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin, "good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything...  </span><span id="en12725">Is it long since you arrived?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12728">"This evening, Rodya," answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "the train was awfully late.  </span><span id="en12730">But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now!  </span><span id="en12732">I will spend the night here, near you..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12735">"Don't torture me!"  </span><span id="en12737">he said with a gesture of irritation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12740">"I will stay with him," cried Razumihin, "I won't leave him for a moment.  </span><span id="en12742">Bother all my visitors!  </span><span id="en12744">Let them rage to their hearts' content!  </span><span id="en12746">My uncle is presiding there." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12749">"How, how can I thank you!"  </span><span id="en12751">Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once more pressing Razumihin's hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12754">"I can't have it!  </span><span id="en12756">I can't have it!"  </span><span id="en12758">he repeated irritably, "don't worry me!  </span><span id="en12760">Enough, go away...  </span><span id="en12762">I can't stand it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12765">"Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute," Dounia whispered in dismay; "we are distressing him, that's evident." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12768">"Mayn't I look at him after three years?"  </span><span id="en12770">wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12773">"Stay," he stopped them again, "you keep interrupting me, and my ideas get muddled....  </span><span id="en12775">Have you seen Luzhin?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12778">"No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival.  </span><span id="en12780">We have heard, Rodya, that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today," Pulcheria Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12783">"Yes...  </span><span id="en12785">he was so kind...  </span><span id="en12787">Dounia, I promised Luzhin I'd throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12790">"Rodya, what are you saying!  </span><span id="en12792">Surely, you don't mean to tell us..."  </span><span id="en12794">Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12797">Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting for what would come next.  </span><span id="en12799">Both of them had heard of the quarrel from Nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it, and were in painful perplexity and suspense. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12802">"Dounia," Raskolnikov continued with an effort, "I don't want that marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin, so that we may never hear his name again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12805">"Good Heavens!"  </span><span id="en12807">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12810">"Brother, think what you are saying!"  </span><span id="en12812">Avdotya Romanovna began impetuously, but immediately checked herself. " </span><span id="en12814">You are not fit to talk now, perhaps; you are tired," she added gently. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12817">"You think I am delirious?  </span><span id="en12819">No...  </span><span id="en12820">You are marrying Luzhin for  </span><i><span id="en12821">my </span></i><span id="en12822">  </span><span id="en12823">sake.  </span><span id="en12825">But I won't accept the sacrifice.  </span><span id="en12827">And so write a letter before to-morrow, to refuse him...  </span><span id="en12829">Let me read it in the morning and that will be the end of it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12833">"That I can't do!"  </span><span id="en12835">the girl cried, offended, "what right have you..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12838">"Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow...  </span><span id="en12840">Don't you see..."  </span><span id="en12842">the mother interposed in dismay. " </span><span id="en12844">Better come away!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12847">"He is raving," Razumihin cried tipsily, "or how would he dare!  </span><span id="en12849">To-morrow all this nonsense will be over...  </span><span id="en12851">to-day he certainly did drive him away.  </span><span id="en12853">That was so.  </span><span id="en12855">And Luzhin got angry, too....  </span><span id="en12857">He made speeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out crest-fallen...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12860">"Then it's true?"  </span><span id="en12862">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12865">"Good-bye till to-morrow, brother," said Dounia compassionately—"let us go, mother...  </span><span id="en12867">Good-bye, Rodya." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12870">"Do you hear, sister," he repeated after them, making a last effort, "I am not delirious; this marriage is—an infamy.  </span><span id="en12872">Let me act like a scoundrel, but you mustn't...  </span><span id="en12874">one is enough...  </span><span id="en12876">and though I am a scoundrel, I wouldn't own such a sister.  </span><span id="en12878">It's me or Luzhin!  </span><span id="en12880">Go now...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12883">"But you're out of your mind!  </span><span id="en12885">Despot!"  </span><span id="en12887">roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer.  </span><span id="en12889">He lay down on the sofa, and turned to the wall, utterly exhausted.  </span><span id="en12891">Avdotya Romanovna looked with interest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively started at her glance. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12894">Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12897">"Nothing would induce me to go," she whispered in despair to Razumihin. " </span><span id="en12899">I will stay somewhere here...  </span><span id="en12901">escort Dounia home." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12904">"You'll spoil everything," Razumihin answered in the same whisper, losing patience—"come out on to the stairs, anyway.  </span><span id="en12906">Nastasya, show a light!  </span><span id="en12908">I assure you," he went on in a half whisper on the stairs—"that he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon!  </span><span id="en12910">Do you understand?  </span><span id="en12912">The doctor himself!  </span><span id="en12914">Even he gave way and left him, so as not to irritate him.  </span><span id="en12916">I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once and slipped off.  </span><span id="en12918">And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this time of night, and will do himself some mischief...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12921">"What are you saying?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12924">"And Avdotya Romanovna can't possibly be left in those lodgings without you.  </span><span id="en12926">Just think where you are staying!  </span><span id="en12928">That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch couldn't find you better lodgings...  </span><span id="en12930">But you know I've had a little to drink, and that's what makes me...  </span><span id="en12932">swear; don't mind it...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en12935">"But I'll go to the landlady here," Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted, "I'll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night.  </span><span id="en12937">I can't leave him like that, I cannot!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en12940">This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady's door.  </span><span id="en12942">Nastasya lighted them from a step below.  </span><span id="en12944">Razumihin was in extraordinary excitement.  </span><span id="en12946">Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing Raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he had imbibed.  </span><span id="en12948">Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect.  </span><span id="en12950">He stood with the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their hands painfully as in a vise.  </span><span id="en12952">He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the least regard for good manners.  </span><span id="en12954">They sometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew them all the closer to him.  </span><span id="en12956">If they'd told him to jump head foremost from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service.  </span><span id="en12958">Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was unwilling to notice all his peculiarities.  </span><span id="en12960">But though Avdotya Romanovna shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm.  </span><span id="en12962">It was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya's account of her brother's queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from him, and to persuade her mother to do the same.  </span><span id="en12964">She realised, too, that even running away was perhaps impossible now.  </span><span id="en12966">Ten minutes later, however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with. </span></p>
<p><span id="en12969">"You can't go to the landlady, that's perfect nonsense!"  </span><span id="en12971">he cried. " </span><span id="en12973">If you stay, though you are his mother, you'll drive him to a frenzy, and then goodness knows what will happen!  </span><span id="en12975">Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I'll conduct you both home, you can't be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that way....  </span><span id="en12977">But no matter!  </span><span id="en12979">Then I'll run straight back here and a quarter of an hour later, on my word of honour, I'll bring you news how he is, whether he is asleep, and all that.  </span><span id="en12981">Then, listen!  </span><span id="en12983">Then I'll run home in a twinkling—I've a lot of friends there, all drunk—I'll fetch Zossimov—that's the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too, but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk!  </span><span id="en12985">I'll drag him to Rodya, and then to you, so that you'll get two reports in the hour—from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that's a very different thing from my account of him!  </span><span id="en12987">If there's anything wrong, I swear I'll bring you here myself, but, if it's all right, you go to bed.  </span><span id="en12989">And I'll spend the night here, in the passage, he won't hear me, and I'll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady's, to be at hand.  </span><span id="en12991">Which is better for him: you or the doctor?  </span><span id="en12993">So come home then!  </span><span id="en12995">But the landlady is out of the question; it's all right for me, but it's out of the question for you: she wouldn't take you, for she's...  </span><span id="en12997">for she's a fool...  </span><span id="en12999">She'd be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you, too, if you want to know...  </span><span id="en13001">of Avdotya Romanovna certainly.  </span><span id="en13003">She is an absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character!  </span><span id="en13005">But I am a fool, too!...  </span><span id="en13007">No matter!  </span><span id="en13009">Come along!  </span><span id="en13011">Do you trust me?  </span><span id="en13013">Come, do you trust me or not?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13016">"Let us go, mother," said Avdotya Romanovna, "he will certainly do what he has promised.  </span><span id="en13018">He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13021">"You see, you...  </span><span id="en13023">you...  </span><span id="en13025">understand me, because you are an angel!"  </span><span id="en13027">Razumihin cried in ecstasy, "let us go!  </span><span id="en13029">Nastasya!  </span><span id="en13031">Fly upstairs and sit with him with a light; I'll come in a quarter of an hour." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13034">Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no further resistance.  </span><span id="en13036">Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs.  </span><span id="en13038">He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and good-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise?  </span><span id="en13040">He seemed in such a condition.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en13043">"Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!"  </span><span id="en13045">Razumihin broke in upon her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he did not observe, however. " </span><span id="en13047">Nonsense!  </span><span id="en13049">That is...  </span><span id="en13051">I am drunk like a fool, but that's not it; I am not drunk from wine.  </span><span id="en13053">It's seeing you has turned my head...  </span><span id="en13055">But don't mind me!  </span><span id="en13057">Don't take any notice: I am talking nonsense, I am not worthy of you....  </span><span id="en13059">I am utterly unworthy of you!  </span><span id="en13061">The minute I've taken you home, I'll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over my head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right....  </span><span id="en13063">If only you knew how I love you both!  </span><span id="en13065">Don't laugh, and don't be angry!  </span><span id="en13067">You may be angry with anyone, but not with me!  </span><span id="en13069">I am his friend, and therefore I am your friend, too, I want to be...  </span><span id="en13071">I had a presentiment...  </span><span id="en13073">Last year there was a moment...  </span><span id="en13075">though it wasn't a presentiment really, for you seem to have fallen from heaven.  </span><span id="en13077">And I expect I shan't sleep all night...  </span><span id="en13079">Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...  </span><span id="en13081">that's why he mustn't be irritated." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13084">"What do you say?"  </span><span id="en13086">cried the mother. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13089">"Did the doctor really say that?"  </span><span id="en13091">asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13094">"Yes, but it's not so, not a bit of it.  </span><span id="en13096">He gave him some medicine, a powder, I saw it, and then your coming here....  </span><span id="en13098">Ah!  </span><span id="en13100">It would have been better if you had come to-morrow.  </span><span id="en13102">It's a good thing we went away.  </span><span id="en13104">And in an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything.  </span><span id="en13106">He is not drunk!  </span><span id="en13108">And I shan't be drunk....  </span><span id="en13110">And what made me get so tight?  </span><span id="en13112">Because they got me into an argument, damn them!  </span><span id="en13114">I've sworn never to argue!  </span><span id="en13116">They talk such trash!  </span><span id="en13118">I almost came to blows!  </span><span id="en13120">I've left my uncle to preside.  </span><span id="en13122">Would you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism and that's just what they relish!  </span><span id="en13124">Not to be themselves, to be as unlike themselves as they can.  </span><span id="en13126">That's what they regard as the highest point of progress.  </span><span id="en13128">If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13131">"Listen!"  </span><span id="en13133">Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added fuel to the flames. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13136">"What do you think?"  </span><span id="en13138">shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, "you think I am attacking them for talking nonsense?  </span><span id="en13140">Not a bit!  </span><span id="en13142">I like them to talk nonsense.  </span><span id="en13144">That's man's one privilege over all creation.  </span><span id="en13146">Through error you come to the truth!  </span><span id="en13148">I am a man because I err!  </span><span id="en13150">You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen.  </span><span id="en13152">And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can't even make mistakes on our own account!  </span><span id="en13154">Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense, and I'll kiss you for it.  </span><span id="en13156">To go wrong in one's own way is better than to go right in someone else's.  </span><span id="en13158">In the first case you are a man, in the second you're no better than a bird.  </span><span id="en13160">Truth won't escape you, but life can be cramped.  </span><span id="en13162">There have been examples.  </span><span id="en13164">And what are we doing now?  </span><span id="en13166">In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism, judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are still in the preparatory class at school.  </span><span id="en13168">We prefer to live on other people's ideas, it's what we are used to!  </span><span id="en13170">Am I right, am I right?"  </span><span id="en13172">cried Razumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies' hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13175">"Oh, mercy, I do not know," cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13178">"Yes, yes...  </span><span id="en13180">though I don't agree with you in everything," added Avdotya Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand so painfully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13183">"Yes, you say yes...  </span><span id="en13185">well after that you...  </span><span id="en13187">you..."  </span><span id="en13189">he cried in a transport, "you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense...  </span><span id="en13191">and perfection.  </span><span id="en13193">Give me your hand...  </span><span id="en13195">you give me yours, too!  </span><span id="en13197">I want to kiss your hands here at once, on my knees..."  </span><span id="en13199">and he fell on his knees on the pavement, fortunately at that time deserted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13202">"Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?"  </span><span id="en13204">Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried, greatly distressed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13207">"Get up, get up!"  </span><span id="en13209">said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13212">"Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands!  </span><span id="en13214">That's it!  </span><span id="en13216">Enough!  </span><span id="en13218">I get up and we'll go on!  </span><span id="en13220">I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and drunk...  </span><span id="en13222">and I am ashamed....  </span><span id="en13224">I am not worthy to love you, but to do homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast!  </span><span id="en13226">And I've done homage....  </span><span id="en13228">Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away....  </span><span id="en13230">How dare he!  </span><span id="en13232">how dare he put you in such lodgings!  </span><span id="en13234">It's a scandal!  </span><span id="en13236">Do you know the sort of people they take in here?  </span><span id="en13238">And you his betrothed!  </span><span id="en13240">You are his betrothed?  </span><span id="en13242">Yes?  </span><span id="en13243">Well, then, I'll tell you, your  </span><i><span id="en13244">fiancé </span></i><span id="en13245">  </span><span id="en13246">is a scoundrel." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13250">"Excuse me, Mr.  </span><span id="en13252">Razumihin, you are forgetting..."  </span><span id="en13254">Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13257">"Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it," Razumihin made haste to apologise. " </span><span id="en13259">But...  </span><span id="en13261">but you can't be angry with me for speaking so!  </span><span id="en13263">For I speak sincerely and not because...  </span><span id="en13265">hm, hm!  </span><span id="en13267">That would be disgraceful; in fact not because I'm in...  </span><span id="en13269">hm!  </span><span id="en13271">Well, anyway, I won't say why, I daren't....  </span><span id="en13273">But we all saw to-day when he came in that that man is not of our sort.  </span><span id="en13275">Not because he had his hair curled at the barber's, not because he was in such a hurry to show his wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint and a buffoon.  </span><span id="en13277">That's evident.  </span><span id="en13279">Do you think him clever?  </span><span id="en13281">No, he is a fool, a fool.  </span><span id="en13283">And is he a match for you?  </span><span id="en13285">Good heavens!  </span><span id="en13287">Do you see, ladies?"  </span><span id="en13289">he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, "though all my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we do talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the truth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...  </span><span id="en13291">is not on the right path.  </span><span id="en13293">Though I've been calling them all sorts of names just now, I do respect them all...  </span><span id="en13295">though I don't respect Zametov, I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he is an honest man and knows his work.  </span><span id="en13297">But enough, it's all said and forgiven.  </span><span id="en13299">Is it forgiven?  </span><span id="en13301">Well, then, let's go on.  </span><span id="en13303">I know this corridor, I've been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3....  </span><span id="en13305">Where are you here?  </span><span id="en13307">Which number?  </span><span id="en13309">eight?  </span><span id="en13311">Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.  </span><span id="en13313">Don't let anybody in.  </span><span id="en13315">In a quarter of an hour I'll come back with news, and half an hour later I'll bring Zossimov, you'll see!  </span><span id="en13317">Good-bye, I'll run." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13320">"Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?"  </span><span id="en13322">said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13325">"Don't worry yourself, mother," said Dounia, taking off her hat and cape. " </span><span id="en13327">God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a drinking party.  </span><span id="en13329">We can depend on him, I assure you.  </span><span id="en13331">And all that he has done for Rodya...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13334">"Ah.  </span><span id="en13336">Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come!  </span><span id="en13338">How could I bring myself to leave Rodya?...  </span><span id="en13340">And how different, how different I had fancied our meeting!  </span><span id="en13342">How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13345">Tears came into her eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13348">"No, it's not that, mother.  </span><span id="en13350">You didn't see, you were crying all the time.  </span><span id="en13352">He is quite unhinged by serious illness—that's the reason." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13355">"Ah, that illness!  </span><span id="en13357">What will happen, what will happen?  </span><span id="en13359">And how he talked to you, Dounia!"  </span><span id="en13361">said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter, trying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia's standing up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven him. " </span><span id="en13363">I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow," she added, probing her further. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13366">"And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow...  </span><span id="en13368">about that," Avdotya Romanovna said finally.  </span><span id="en13370">And, of course, there was no going beyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was afraid to discuss.  </span><span id="en13372">Dounia went up and kissed her mother.  </span><span id="en13374">The latter warmly embraced her without speaking.  </span><span id="en13376">Then she sat down to wait anxiously for Razumihin's return, timidly watching her daughter who walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.  </span><span id="en13378">This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya Romanovna's and the mother was always afraid to break in on her daughter's mood at such moments. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13381">Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation for Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en13383">Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya Romanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy.  </span><span id="en13385">Avdotya Romanovna was remarkably good looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned, strong and self-reliant—the latter quality was apparent in every gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements.  </span><span id="en13387">In face she resembled her brother, but she might be described as really beautiful.  </span><span id="en13389">Her hair was dark brown, a little lighter than her brother's; there was a proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness.  </span><span id="en13391">She was pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness and vigour.  </span><span id="en13393">Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty expression.  </span><span id="en13395">Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay; but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible, laughter suited her face!  </span><span id="en13397">It was natural enough that a warm, open, simple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone like her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head immediately.  </span><span id="en13399">Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at meeting him.  </span><span id="en13401">Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother's insolent, cruel and ungrateful words—and his fate was sealed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13404">He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov's eccentric landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of Avdotya Romanovna on his account.  </span><span id="en13406">Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age.  </span><span id="en13408">We may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age.  </span><span id="en13410">Her hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow's foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face.  </span><span id="en13412">She was Dounia over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.  </span><span id="en13414">Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, but only to a certain point.  </span><span id="en13416">She could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13419">Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin's departure, there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13422">"I won't come in, I haven't time," he hastened to say when the door was opened. " </span><span id="en13424">He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may sleep ten hours.  </span><span id="en13426">Nastasya's with him; I told her not to leave till I came.  </span><span id="en13428">Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you'd better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13431">And he ran off down the corridor. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13434">"What a very competent and...  </span><span id="en13436">devoted young man!"  </span><span id="en13438">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13441">"He seems a splendid person!"  </span><span id="en13443">Avdotya Romanovna replied with some warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13446">It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor and another knock at the door.  </span><span id="en13448">Both women waited this time completely relying on Razumihin's promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing Zossimov.  </span><span id="en13450">Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to Raskolnikov's, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated condition.  </span><span id="en13452">But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw that they were really expecting him as an oracle.  </span><span id="en13454">He stayed just ten minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria Alexandrovna.  </span><span id="en13456">He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.  </span><span id="en13458">He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two ladies.  </span><span id="en13460">Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna.  </span><span id="en13462">All this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction.  </span><span id="en13464">He declared that he thought the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily.  </span><span id="en13466">According to his observations the patient's illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also a moral origin, "was, so to speak, the product of several material and moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...  </span><span id="en13468">and so on."  </span><span id="en13470">Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme.  </span><span id="en13472">On Pulcheria Alexandrovna's anxiously and timidly inquiring as to "some suspicion of insanity," he replied with a composed and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania—he, Zossimov, was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine—but that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in delirium and...  </span><span id="en13474">and that no doubt the presence of his family would have a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, "if only all fresh shocks can be avoided," he added significantly.  </span><span id="en13476">Then he got up, took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna spontaneously offered her hand to him.  </span><span id="en13478">He went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and still more so with himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13481">"We'll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!"  </span><span id="en13483">Razumihin said in conclusion, following Zossimov out. " </span><span id="en13485">I'll be with you to-morrow morning as early as possible with my report." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13488">"That's a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna," remarked Zossimov, almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13491">"Fetching?  </span><span id="en13493">You said fetching?"  </span><span id="en13495">roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov and seized him by the throat. " </span><span id="en13497">If you ever dare....  </span><span id="en13499">Do you understand?  </span><span id="en13501">Do you understand?"  </span><span id="en13503">he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing him against the wall. " </span><span id="en13505">Do you hear?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13508">"Let me go, you drunken devil," said Zossimov, struggling and when he had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.  </span><span id="en13510">Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13513">"Of course, I am an ass," he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, "but still...  </span><span id="en13515">you are another." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13518">"No, brother, not at all such another.  </span><span id="en13520">I am not dreaming of any folly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13523">They walked along in silence and only when they were close to Raskolnikov's lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable anxiety. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13526">"Listen," he said, "you're a first-rate fellow, but among your other failings, you're a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too.  </span><span id="en13528">You are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you're getting fat and lazy and can't deny yourself anything—and I call that dirty because it leads one straight into the dirt.  </span><span id="en13530">You've let yourself get so slack that I don't know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.  </span><span id="en13532">You—a doctor—sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your patients!  </span><span id="en13534">In another three or four years you won't get up for your patients...  </span><span id="en13536">But hang it all, that's not the point!...  </span><span id="en13538">You are going to spend to-night in the landlady's flat here.  </span><span id="en13540">(Hard work I've had to persuade her! </span><span id="en13542">) And I'll be in the kitchen.  </span><span id="en13544">So here's a chance for you to get to know her better....  </span><span id="en13546">It's not as you think!  </span><span id="en13548">There's not a trace of anything of the sort, brother...!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13551">"But I don't think!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13554">"Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage virtue...  </span><span id="en13556">and yet she's sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!  </span><span id="en13558">Save me from her, by all that's unholy!  </span><span id="en13560">She's most prepossessing...  </span><span id="en13562">I'll repay you, I'll do anything...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13565">Zossimov laughed more violently than ever. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13568">"Well, you are smitten!  </span><span id="en13570">But what am I to do with her?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13573">"It won't be much trouble, I assure you.  </span><span id="en13575">Talk any rot you like to her, as long as you sit by her and talk.  </span><span id="en13577">You're a doctor, too; try curing her of something.  </span><span id="en13579">I swear you won't regret it.  </span><span id="en13581">She has a piano, and you know, I strum a little.  </span><span id="en13583">I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: 'I shed hot tears. </span><span id="en13584">' She likes the genuine article—and well, it all began with that song; Now you're a regular performer, a  </span><i><span id="en13585">maître </span></i><span id="en13587">, a Rubinstein....  </span><span id="en13589">I assure you, you won't regret it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13593">"But have you made her some promise?  </span><span id="en13595">Something signed?  </span><span id="en13597">A promise of marriage, perhaps?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13600">"Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind!  </span><span id="en13602">Besides she is not that sort at all....  </span><span id="en13604">Tchebarov tried that...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13607">"Well then, drop her!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13610">"But I can't drop her like that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13613">"Why can't you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13616">"Well, I can't, that's all about it!  </span><span id="en13618">There's an element of attraction here, brother." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13621">"Then why have you fascinated her?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13624">"I haven't fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.  </span><span id="en13626">But she won't care a straw whether it's you or I, so long as somebody sits beside her, sighing....  </span><span id="en13628">I can't explain the position, brother...  </span><span id="en13630">look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now...  </span><span id="en13632">begin teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I'm not joking, I'm in earnest, it'll be just the same to her.  </span><span id="en13634">She will gaze at you and sigh for a whole year together.  </span><span id="en13636">I talked to her once for two days at a time about the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)—she just sighed and perspired!  </span><span id="en13638">And you mustn't talk of love—she's bashful to hysterics—but just let her see you can't tear yourself away—that's enough.  </span><span id="en13640">It's fearfully comfortable; you're quite at home, you can read, sit, lie about, write.  </span><span id="en13642">You may even venture on a kiss, if you're careful." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13645">"But what do I want with her?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13648">"Ach, I can't make you understand!  </span><span id="en13650">You see, you are made for each other!  </span><span id="en13652">I have often been reminded of you!...  </span><span id="en13654">You'll come to it in the end!  </span><span id="en13656">So does it matter whether it's sooner or later?  </span><span id="en13658">There's the feather-bed element here, brother—ach!  </span><span id="en13660">and not only that!  </span><span id="en13662">There's an attraction here—here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven, the navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the world, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening samovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on—as snug as though you were dead, and yet you're alive—the advantages of both at once!  </span><span id="en13664">Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I'm talking, it's bedtime!  </span><span id="en13666">Listen.  </span><span id="en13668">I sometimes wake up at night; so I'll go in and look at him.  </span><span id="en13670">But there's no need, it's all right.  </span><span id="en13672">Don't you worry yourself, yet if you like, you might just look in once, too.  </span><span id="en13674">But if you notice anything—delirium or fever—wake me at once.  </span><span id="en13676">But there can't be...." </span></p>

<p><span id="en13680">Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o'clock, troubled and serious.  </span><span id="en13682">He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.  </span><span id="en13684">He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that.  </span><span id="en13686">He remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression unlike anything he had known before.  </span><span id="en13688">At the same time he recognised clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly unattainable—so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties bequeathed him by that "thrice accursed yesterday." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13690">The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown himself "base and mean," not only because he had been drunk, but because he had taken advantage of the young girl's position to abuse her  </span><i><span id="en13691">fiancé </span></i><span id="en13692">  </span><span id="en13693">in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself.  </span><span id="en13695">And what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?  </span><span id="en13697">Who had asked for his opinion?  </span><span id="en13699">Was it thinkable that such a creature as Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money?  </span><span id="en13701">So there must be something in him.  </span><span id="en13703">The lodgings?  </span><span id="en13705">But after all how could he know the character of the lodgings?  </span><span id="en13707">He was furnishing a flat...  </span><span id="en13709">Foo!  </span><span id="en13711">how despicable it all was!  </span><span id="en13713">And what justification was it that he was drunk?  </span><span id="en13715">Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading!  </span><span id="en13717">In wine is truth, and the truth had all come out, "that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart"!  </span><span id="en13719">And would such a dream ever be permissible to him, Razumihin?  </span><span id="en13721">What was he beside such a girl—he, the drunken noisy braggart of last night?  </span><span id="en13723">Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition?  </span><span id="en13725">Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya Romanovna...  </span><span id="en13727">that was simply intolerable.  </span><span id="en13729">He brought his fist down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the bricks flying. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13733">"Of course," he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-abasement, "of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or smoothed over...  </span><span id="en13735">and so it's useless even to think of it, and I must go to them in silence and do my duty...  </span><span id="en13737">in silence, too...  </span><span id="en13739">and not ask forgiveness, and say nothing...  </span><span id="en13741">for all is lost now!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13744">And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.  </span><span id="en13746">He hadn't another suit—if he had had, perhaps he wouldn't have put it on. " </span><span id="en13748">I would have made a point of not putting it on."  </span><span id="en13750">But in any case he could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his assistance and asking him to see them.  </span><span id="en13752">He brushed his clothes carefully.  </span><span id="en13754">His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13757">He washed that morning scrupulously—he got some soap from Nastasya—he washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands.  </span><span id="en13759">When it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question was angrily answered in the negative. " </span><span id="en13761">Let it stay as it is!  </span><span id="en13763">What if they think that I shaved on purpose to...?  </span><span id="en13765">They certainly would think so!  </span><span id="en13767">Not on any account!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13770">"And...  </span><span id="en13772">the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the manners of a pothouse; and...  </span><span id="en13774">and even admitting that he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman...  </span><span id="en13776">what was there in that to be proud of?  </span><span id="en13778">Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that...  </span><span id="en13780">and all the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things...  </span><span id="en13782">not exactly dishonest, and yet....  </span><span id="en13784">And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm...  </span><span id="en13786">and to set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna!  </span><span id="en13788">Confound it!  </span><span id="en13790">So be it!  </span><span id="en13792">Well, he'd make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he wouldn't care!  </span><span id="en13794">He'd be worse!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13797">He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night in Praskovya Pavlovna's parlour, came in. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13800">He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.  </span><span id="en13802">Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.  </span><span id="en13804">Zossimov gave orders that they shouldn't wake him and promised to see him again about eleven. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13807">"If he is still at home," he added. " </span><span id="en13809">Damn it all!  </span><span id="en13811">If one can't control one's patients, how is one to cure them?  </span><span id="en13812">Do you know whether  </span><i><span id="en13813">he </span></i><span id="en13814"> will go to them, or whether  </span><i><span id="en13815">they </span></i><span id="en13816">  </span><span id="en13817">are coming here?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13822">"They are coming, I think," said Razumihin, understanding the object of the question, "and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.  </span><span id="en13824">I'll be off.  </span><span id="en13826">You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13829">"But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I've plenty to do besides looking after them." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13832">"One thing worries me," interposed Razumihin, frowning. " </span><span id="en13834">On the way home I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him...  </span><span id="en13836">all sorts of things...  </span><span id="en13838">and amongst them that you were afraid that he...  </span><span id="en13840">might become insane." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13843">"You told the ladies so, too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13846">"I know it was stupid!  </span><span id="en13848">You may beat me if you like!  </span><span id="en13850">Did you think so seriously?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13853">"That's nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously?  </span><span id="en13855">You, yourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to him...  </span><span id="en13857">and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was, perhaps, mad on that very point!  </span><span id="en13859">If only I'd known what happened then at the police station and that some wretch...  </span><span id="en13861">had insulted him with this suspicion!  </span><span id="en13863">Hm...  </span><span id="en13865">I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.  </span><span id="en13867">These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill...  </span><span id="en13869">and see their fancies as solid realities....  </span><span id="en13871">As far as I remember, it was Zametov's story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind.  </span><span id="en13873">Why, I know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat of a little boy of eight, because he couldn't endure the jokes he made every day at table!  </span><span id="en13875">And in this case his rags, the insolent police officer, the fever and this suspicion!  </span><span id="en13877">All that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity!  </span><span id="en13879">That may well have been the starting-point of illness.  </span><span id="en13881">Well, bother it all!...  </span><span id="en13883">And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but hm...  </span><span id="en13885">he shouldn't have told all that last night.  </span><span id="en13887">He is an awful chatterbox!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13890">"But whom did he tell it to?  </span><span id="en13892">You and me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13895">"And Porfiry." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13898">"What does that matter?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13901">"And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?  </span><span id="en13903">Tell them to be more careful with him to-day...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13906">"They'll get on all right!"  </span><span id="en13908">Razumihin answered reluctantly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13911">"Why is he so set against this Luzhin?  </span><span id="en13913">A man with money and she doesn't seem to dislike him...  </span><span id="en13915">and they haven't a farthing, I suppose?  </span><span id="en13917">eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en13920">"But what business is it of yours?"  </span><span id="en13922">Razumihin cried with annoyance. " </span><span id="en13924">How can I tell whether they've a farthing?  </span><span id="en13926">Ask them yourself and perhaps you'll find out...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13929">"Foo!  </span><span id="en13931">what an ass you are sometimes!  </span><span id="en13933">Last night's wine has not gone off yet....  </span><span id="en13935">Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night's lodging.  </span><span id="en13936">She locked herself in, made no reply to my  </span><i><span id="en13937">bonjour </span></i><span id="en13938">  </span><span id="en13939">through the door; she was up at seven o'clock, the samovar was taken into her from the kitchen.  </span><span id="en13941">I was not vouchsafed a personal interview...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13945">At nine o'clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev's house.  </span><span id="en13947">Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience.  </span><span id="en13949">They had risen at seven o'clock or earlier.  </span><span id="en13951">He entered looking as black as night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it.  </span><span id="en13953">He had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them.  </span><span id="en13955">He glanced timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater confusion than if he had been met with abuse.  </span><span id="en13957">Fortunately there was a subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13960">Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked, Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because "she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over beforehand."  </span><span id="en13962">Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him.  </span><span id="en13964">Avdotya Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed.  </span><span id="en13966">Razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna's questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13969">He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov's life, concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness.  </span><span id="en13971">He omitted, however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at the police station with all its consequences.  </span><span id="en13973">They listened eagerly to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13976">"Tell me, tell me!  </span><span id="en13978">What do you think...?  </span><span id="en13980">Excuse me, I still don't know your name!"  </span><span id="en13982">Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en13985">"Dmitri Prokofitch." </span></p>
<p><span id="en13988">"I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch...  </span><span id="en13990">how he looks...  </span><span id="en13992">on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are his likes and dislikes?  </span><span id="en13994">Is he always so irritable?  </span><span id="en13996">Tell me, if you can, what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams?  </span><span id="en13998">Under what influences is he now?  </span><span id="en14000">In a word, I should like..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14003">"Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?"  </span><span id="en14005">observed Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14008">"Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this, Dmitri Prokofitch!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14011">"Naturally," answered Razumihin. " </span><span id="en14013">I have no mother, but my uncle comes every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years' separation means a great deal.  </span><span id="en14015">What am I to tell you?  </span><span id="en14017">I have known Rodion for a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of late—and perhaps for a long time before—he has been suspicious and fanciful.  </span><span id="en14019">He has a noble nature and a kind heart.  </span><span id="en14021">He does not like showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his heart freely.  </span><span id="en14023">Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply cold and inhumanly callous; it's as though he were alternating between two characters.  </span><span id="en14025">Sometimes he is fearfully reserved!  </span><span id="en14027">He says he is so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing nothing.  </span><span id="en14029">He doesn't jeer at things, not because he hasn't the wit, but as though he hadn't time to waste on such trifles.  </span><span id="en14031">He never listens to what is said to him.  </span><span id="en14033">He is never interested in what interests other people at any given moment.  </span><span id="en14035">He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is right.  </span><span id="en14037">Well, what more?  </span><span id="en14039">I think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14042">"God grant it may," cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by Razumihin's account of her Rodya. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14045">And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.  </span><span id="en14047">He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and looked away again at once.  </span><span id="en14049">Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question, without stopping her walk.  </span><span id="en14051">She had the same habit of not listening to what was said.  </span><span id="en14053">She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck.  </span><span id="en14055">Razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings.  </span><span id="en14057">Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very trying for a man who already felt diffident. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14060">"You've told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother's character...  </span><span id="en14062">and have told it impartially.  </span><span id="en14064">I am glad.  </span><span id="en14066">I thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him," observed Avdotya Romanovna with a smile. " </span><span id="en14068">I think you are right that he needs a woman's care," she added thoughtfully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14071">"I didn't say so; but I daresay you are right, only..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14074">"What?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14077">"He loves no one and perhaps he never will," Razumihin declared decisively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14080">"You mean he is not capable of love?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14083">"Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in everything, indeed!"  </span><span id="en14085">he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother, he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion.  </span><span id="en14087">Avdotya Romanovna couldn't help laughing when she looked at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14090">"You may both be mistaken about Rodya," Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked, slightly piqued. " </span><span id="en14092">I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.  </span><span id="en14094">What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have supposed may be mistaken, but you can't imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how moody and, so to say, capricious he is.  </span><span id="en14096">I never could depend on what he would do when he was only fifteen.  </span><span id="en14098">And I am sure that he might do something now that nobody else would think of doing...  </span><span id="en14100">Well, for instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that girl—what was her name—his landlady's daughter?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14103">"Did you hear about that affair?"  </span><span id="en14105">asked Avdotya Romanovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14108">"Do you suppose——" Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. " </span><span id="en14110">Do you suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from grief, our poverty would have made him pause?  </span><span id="en14112">No, he would calmly have disregarded all obstacles.  </span><span id="en14114">And yet it isn't that he doesn't love us!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14117">"He has never spoken a word of that affair to me," Razumihin answered cautiously. " </span><span id="en14119">But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself, though she is by no means a gossip.  </span><span id="en14121">And what I heard certainly was rather strange." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14124">"And what did you hear?"  </span><span id="en14126">both the ladies asked at once. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14129">"Well, nothing very special.  </span><span id="en14131">I only learned that the marriage, which only failed to take place through the girl's death, was not at all to Praskovya Pavlovna's liking.  </span><span id="en14133">They say, too, the girl was not at all pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly...  </span><span id="en14135">and such an invalid...  </span><span id="en14137">and queer.  </span><span id="en14139">But she seems to have had some good qualities.  </span><span id="en14141">She must have had some good qualities or it's quite inexplicable....  </span><span id="en14143">She had no money either and he wouldn't have considered her money....  </span><span id="en14145">But it's always difficult to judge in such matters." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14148">"I am sure she was a good girl," Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14151">"God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death.  </span><span id="en14153">Though I don't know which of them would have caused most misery to the other—he to her or she to him," Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded.  </span><span id="en14155">Then she began tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to the latter's annoyance.  </span><span id="en14157">This incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness, even consternation.  </span><span id="en14159">Razumihin described it in detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14162">"He had planned it before his illness," he added. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14165">"I think so, too," Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.  </span><span id="en14167">But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en14169">Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14172">"So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?"  </span><span id="en14174">Pulcheria Alexandrovna could not resist asking. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14177">"I can have no other opinion of your daughter's future husband," Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, "and I don't say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because...  </span><span id="en14179">simply because Avdotya Romanovna has of her own free will deigned to accept this man.  </span><span id="en14181">If I spoke so rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...  </span><span id="en14183">mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely...  </span><span id="en14185">and this morning I am ashamed of it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14188">He crimsoned and ceased speaking.  </span><span id="en14190">Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not break the silence.  </span><span id="en14192">She had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14195">Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what to do.  </span><span id="en14197">At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14200">"You see, Dmitri Prokofitch," she began. " </span><span id="en14202">I'll be perfectly open with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14205">"Of course, mother," said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14208">"This is what it is," she began in haste, as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. " </span><span id="en14210">Very early this morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival.  </span><span id="en14212">He promised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning.  </span><span id="en14214">But this morning this note came from him.  </span><span id="en14216">You'd better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me very much...  </span><span id="en14218">you will soon see what that is, and...  </span><span id="en14220">tell me your candid opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch!  </span><span id="en14222">You know Rodya's character better than anyone and no one can advise us better than you can.  </span><span id="en14224">Dounia, I must tell you, made her decision at once, but I still don't feel sure how to act and I...  </span><span id="en14226">I've been waiting for your opinion." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14228">Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read as follows: </span></p>
<p><span id="en14230">"Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object in view.  </span><span id="en14232">I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother.  </span><span id="en14234">I shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not later than to-morrow evening at eight o'clock precisely, and herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview—as he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own interpretation.  </span><span id="en14236">I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation, that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame.  </span><span id="en14238">I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able to leave the house, may visit you also.  </span><span id="en14240">I was confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to raise that sum.  </span><span id="en14241">Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage of </span></p>
<p><span id="en14242">"Your humble servant, </span></p>
<p><span id="en14244">"P.  </span><span id="en14246">LUZHIN." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14249">"What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?"  </span><span id="en14251">began Pulcheria Alexandrovna, almost weeping. " </span><span id="en14253">How can I ask Rodya not to come?  </span><span id="en14255">Yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive Rodya!  </span><span id="en14257">He will come on purpose if he knows, and...  </span><span id="en14259">what will happen then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14262">"Act on Avdotya Romanovna's decision," Razumihin answered calmly at once. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14265">"Oh, dear me!  </span><span id="en14267">She says...  </span><span id="en14269">goodness knows what she says, she doesn't explain her object!  </span><span id="en14271">She says that it would be best, at least, not that it would be best, but that it's absolutely necessary that Rodya should make a point of being here at eight o'clock and that they must meet....  </span><span id="en14273">I didn't want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help...  </span><span id="en14275">because he is so irritable....  </span><span id="en14277">Besides I don't understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the money...  </span><span id="en14279">which..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14282">"Which cost you such sacrifice, mother," put in Avdotya Romanovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14285">"He was not himself yesterday," Razumihin said thoughtfully, "if you only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there was sense in it too....  </span><span id="en14287">Hm!  </span><span id="en14289">He did say something, as we were going home yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn't understand a word....  </span><span id="en14291">But last night, I myself..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14294">"The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and there I assure you we shall see at once what's to be done.  </span><span id="en14296">Besides, it's getting late—good heavens, it's past ten," she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress. " </span><span id="en14297">A present from her  </span><i><span id="en14298">fiancé </span></i><span id="en14300">," thought Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14304">"We must start, Dounia, we must start," her mother cried in a flutter. " </span><span id="en14306">He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming so late.  </span><span id="en14308">Merciful heavens!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14311">While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle; Dounia, too, put on her things.  </span><span id="en14313">Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes.  </span><span id="en14315">Razumihin looked reverently at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. " </span><span id="en14317">The queen who mended her stockings in prison," he thought, "must have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14320">"My God!"  </span><span id="en14322">exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "little did I think that I should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya!  </span><span id="en14324">I am afraid, Dmitri Prokofitch," she added, glancing at him timidly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14327">"Don't be afraid, mother," said Dounia, kissing her, "better have faith in him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14330">"Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven't slept all night," exclaimed the poor woman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14333">They came out into the street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14336">"Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of Marfa Petrovna...  </span><span id="en14338">she was all in white...  </span><span id="en14340">she came up to me, took my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were blaming me....  </span><span id="en14342">Is that a good omen?  </span><span id="en14344">Oh, dear me!  </span><span id="en14346">You don't know, Dmitri Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna's dead!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14349">"No, I didn't know; who is Marfa Petrovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14352">"She died suddenly; and only fancy..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14355">"Afterwards, mamma," put in Dounia. " </span><span id="en14357">He doesn't know who Marfa Petrovna is." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14360">"Ah, you don't know?  </span><span id="en14362">And I was thinking that you knew all about us.  </span><span id="en14364">Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don't know what I am thinking about these last few days.  </span><span id="en14366">I look upon you really as a providence for us, and so I took it for granted that you knew all about us.  </span><span id="en14368">I look on you as a relation....  </span><span id="en14370">Don't be angry with me for saying so.  </span><span id="en14372">Dear me, what's the matter with your right hand?  </span><span id="en14374">Have you knocked it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14377">"Yes, I bruised it," muttered Razumihin overjoyed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14380">"I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault with me....  </span><span id="en14382">But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in!  </span><span id="en14384">I wonder whether he is awake?  </span><span id="en14386">Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room?  </span><span id="en14388">Listen, you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy him with my...  </span><span id="en14390">weaknesses?  </span><span id="en14392">Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to treat him?  </span><span id="en14394">I feel quite distracted, you know." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14397">"Don't question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don't ask him too much about his health; he doesn't like that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14400">"Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother!  </span><span id="en14402">But here are the stairs....  </span><span id="en14404">What an awful staircase!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14407">"Mother, you are quite pale, don't distress yourself, darling," said Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: "He ought to be happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14410">"Wait, I'll peep in and see whether he has waked up." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14413">The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they reached the landlady's door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within.  </span><span id="en14415">When their eyes met, the door was suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried out. </span></p>

<p><span id="en14419">"He is well, quite well!"  </span><span id="en14421">Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14424">He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place as before, on the sofa.  </span><span id="en14426">Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner, fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for some time past.  </span><span id="en14428">The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14431">Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre.  </span><span id="en14433">He looked like a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.  </span><span id="en14435">His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish.  </span><span id="en14437">He spoke little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a restlessness in his movements. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14440">He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm.  </span><span id="en14442">The pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in place of its listless dejection.  </span><span id="en14444">The light soon died away, but the look of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable torture.  </span><span id="en14446">He saw later that almost every word of the following conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it.  </span><span id="en14448">But at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14451">"Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well," said Raskolnikov, giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria Alexandrovna radiant at once. " </span><span id="en14452">And I don't say this  </span><i><span id="en14453">as I did yesterday </span></i><span id="en14455">," he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of his hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14459">"Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day," began Zossimov, much delighted at the ladies' entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. " </span><span id="en14461">In another three or four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is, as he was a month ago, or two...  </span><span id="en14463">or perhaps even three.  </span><span id="en14465">This has been coming on for a long while....  </span><span id="en14467">eh?  </span><span id="en14469">Confess, now, that it has been perhaps your own fault?"  </span><span id="en14471">he added, with a tentative smile, as though still afraid of irritating him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14474">"It is very possible," answered Raskolnikov coldly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14477">"I should say, too," continued Zossimov with zest, "that your complete recovery depends solely on yourself.  </span><span id="en14479">Now that one can talk to you, I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go from bad to worse.  </span><span id="en14481">These fundamental causes I don't know, but they must be known to you.  </span><span id="en14483">You are an intelligent man, and must have observed yourself, of course.  </span><span id="en14485">I fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university.  </span><span id="en14487">You must not be left without occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I fancy, be very beneficial." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14490">"Yes, yes; you are perfectly right....  </span><span id="en14492">I will make haste and return to the university: and then everything will go smoothly...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14495">Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face.  </span><span id="en14497">This lasted an instant, however.  </span><span id="en14499">Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking Zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14502">"What!  </span><span id="en14504">he saw you last night?"  </span><span id="en14506">Raskolnikov asked, as though startled. " </span><span id="en14508">Then you have not slept either after your journey." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14511">"Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o'clock.  </span><span id="en14513">Dounia and I never go to bed before two at home." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14516">"I don't know how to thank him either," Raskolnikov went on, suddenly frowning and looking down. " </span><span id="en14518">Setting aside the question of payment—forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)—I really don't know what I have done to deserve such special attention from you!  </span><span id="en14520">I simply don't understand it...  </span><span id="en14522">and...  </span><span id="en14524">and...  </span><span id="en14526">it weighs upon me, indeed, because I don't understand it.  </span><span id="en14528">I tell you so candidly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14531">"Don't be irritated."  </span><span id="en14533">Zossimov forced himself to laugh. " </span><span id="en14535">Assume that you are my first patient—well—we fellows just beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in love with them.  </span><span id="en14537">And, of course, I am not rich in patients." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14540">"I say nothing about him," added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin, "though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14543">"What nonsense he is talking!  </span><span id="en14545">Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day, are you?"  </span><span id="en14547">shouted Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14550">If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.  </span><span id="en14552">But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it.  </span><span id="en14554">She was intently and uneasily watching her brother. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14557">"As for you, mother, I don't dare to speak," he went on, as though repeating a lesson learned by heart. " </span><span id="en14559">It is only to-day that I have been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here yesterday, waiting for me to come back." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14562">When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister, smiling without a word.  </span><span id="en14564">But in this smile there was a flash of real unfeigned feeling.  </span><span id="en14566">Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his hand, overjoyed and thankful.  </span><span id="en14568">It was the first time he had addressed her since their dispute the previous day.  </span><span id="en14570">The mother's face lighted up with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation. " </span><span id="en14572">Yes, that is what I love him for," Razumihin, exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his chair. " </span><span id="en14574">He has these movements." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14577">"And how well he does it all," the mother was thinking to herself. " </span><span id="en14579">What generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end to all the misunderstanding with his sister—simply by holding out his hand at the right minute and looking at her like that....  </span><span id="en14581">And what fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!...  </span><span id="en14583">He is even better looking than Dounia....  </span><span id="en14585">But, good heavens, what a suit—how terribly he's dressed!...  </span><span id="en14587">Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch's shop, is better dressed!  </span><span id="en14589">I could rush at him and hug him...  </span><span id="en14591">weep over him—but I am afraid....  </span><span id="en14593">Oh, dear, he's so strange!  </span><span id="en14595">He's talking kindly, but I'm afraid!  </span><span id="en14597">Why, what am I afraid of?..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14600">"Oh, Rodya, you wouldn't believe," she began suddenly, in haste to answer his words to her, "how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday!  </span><span id="en14602">Now that it's all over and done with and we are quite happy again—I can tell you.  </span><span id="en14604">Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that woman—ah, here she is!  </span><span id="en14606">Good morning, Nastasya!...  </span><span id="en14608">She told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the streets.  </span><span id="en14610">You can't imagine how we felt!  </span><span id="en14612">I couldn't help thinking of the tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father's—you can't remember him, Rodya—who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn't pull him out till next day.  </span><span id="en14614">Of course, we exaggerated things.  </span><span id="en14616">We were on the point of rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help....  </span><span id="en14618">Because we were alone, utterly alone," she said plaintively and stopped short, suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr Petrovitch, although "we are quite happy again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14621">"Yes, yes....  </span><span id="en14623">Of course it's very annoying...."  </span><span id="en14625">Raskolnikov muttered in reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed at him in perplexity. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14628">"What else was it I wanted to say?"  </span><span id="en14630">He went on trying to recollect. " </span><span id="en14632">Oh, yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don't think that I didn't mean to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14635">"What are you saying, Rodya?"  </span><span id="en14637">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.  </span><span id="en14639">She, too, was surprised. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14642">"Is he answering us as a duty?"  </span><span id="en14644">Dounia wondered. " </span><span id="en14646">Is he being reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating a lesson?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14649">"I've only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her...  </span><span id="en14651">Nastasya...  </span><span id="en14653">to wash out the blood...  </span><span id="en14655">I've only just dressed." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14658">"Blood!  </span><span id="en14660">What blood?"  </span><span id="en14662">Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14665">"Oh, nothing—don't be uneasy.  </span><span id="en14667">It was when I was wandering about yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run over...  </span><span id="en14669">a clerk..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14672">"Delirious?  </span><span id="en14674">But you remember everything!"  </span><span id="en14676">Razumihin interrupted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14679">"That's true," Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. " </span><span id="en14681">I remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet—why I did that and went there and said that, I can't clearly explain now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14684">"A familiar phenomenon," interposed Zossimov, "actions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions—it's like a dream." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14687">"Perhaps it's a good thing really that he should think me almost a madman," thought Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14690">"Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too," observed Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14693">"There is some truth in your observation," the latter replied. " </span><span id="en14695">In that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we must draw a line.  </span><span id="en14697">A normal man, it is true, hardly exists.  </span><span id="en14699">Among dozens—perhaps hundreds of thousands—hardly one is to be met with." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14702">At the word "madman," carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on his favourite subject, everyone frowned. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14705">Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a strange smile on his pale lips.  </span><span id="en14707">He was still meditating on something. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14710">"Well, what about the man who was run over?  </span><span id="en14712">I interrupted you!"  </span><span id="en14714">Razumihin cried hastily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14717">"What?"  </span><span id="en14719">Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. " </span><span id="en14721">Oh...  </span><span id="en14723">I got spattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging.  </span><span id="en14725">By the way, mamma, I did an unpardonable thing yesterday.  </span><span id="en14727">I was literally out of my mind.  </span><span id="en14729">I gave away all the money you sent me...  </span><span id="en14731">to his wife for the funeral.  </span><span id="en14733">She's a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature...  </span><span id="en14735">three little children, starving...  </span><span id="en14737">nothing in the house...  </span><span id="en14739">there's a daughter, too...  </span><span id="en14741">perhaps you'd have given it yourself if you'd seen them.  </span><span id="en14743">But I had no right to do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.  </span><span id="en14744">To help others one must have the right to do it, or else  </span><i><span id="en14745">Crevez, chiens, si vous n'êtes pas contents </span></i><span id="en14747">." He laughed, "That's right, isn't it, Dounia?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14751">"No, it's not," answered Dounia firmly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14754">"Bah!  </span><span id="en14756">you, too, have ideals," he muttered, looking at her almost with hatred, and smiling sarcastically. " </span><span id="en14758">I ought to have considered that....  </span><span id="en14760">Well, that's praiseworthy, and it's better for you...  </span><span id="en14762">and if you reach a line you won't overstep, you will be unhappy...  </span><span id="en14764">and if you overstep it, maybe you will be still unhappier....  </span><span id="en14766">But all that's nonsense," he added irritably, vexed at being carried away. " </span><span id="en14768">I only meant to say that I beg your forgiveness, mother," he concluded, shortly and abruptly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14771">"That's enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good," said his mother, delighted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14774">"Don't be too sure," he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14777">A silence followed.  </span><span id="en14779">There was a certain constraint in all this conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the forgiveness, and all were feeling it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14782">"It is as though they were afraid of me," Raskolnikov was thinking to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister.  </span><span id="en14784">Pulcheria Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14787">"Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much," flashed through his mind. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14790">"Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead," Pulcheria Alexandrovna suddenly blurted out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14793">"What Marfa Petrovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14796">"Oh, mercy on us—Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en14798">I wrote you so much about her." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14801">"A-a-h!  </span><span id="en14803">Yes, I remember....  </span><span id="en14805">So she's dead!  </span><span id="en14807">Oh, really?"  </span><span id="en14809">he roused himself suddenly, as if waking up. " </span><span id="en14811">What did she die of?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14814">"Only imagine, quite suddenly," Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. " </span><span id="en14816">On the very day I was sending you that letter!  </span><span id="en14818">Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been the cause of her death.  </span><span id="en14820">They say he beat her dreadfully." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14823">"Why, were they on such bad terms?"  </span><span id="en14825">he asked, addressing his sister. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14828">"Not at all.  </span><span id="en14830">Quite the contrary indeed.  </span><span id="en14832">With her, he was always very patient, considerate even.  </span><span id="en14834">In fact, all those seven years of their married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases.  </span><span id="en14836">All of a sudden he seems to have lost patience." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14839">"Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven years?  </span><span id="en14841">You seem to be defending him, Dounia?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14844">"No, no, he's an awful man!  </span><span id="en14846">I can imagine nothing more awful!"  </span><span id="en14848">Dounia answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14851">"That had happened in the morning," Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on hurriedly. " </span><span id="en14853">And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner.  </span><span id="en14855">She always used to drive to the town in such cases.  </span><span id="en14857">She ate a very good dinner, I am told...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14860">"After the beating?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14863">"That was always her...  </span><span id="en14865">habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house....  </span><span id="en14867">You see, she was undergoing some treatment with baths.  </span><span id="en14869">They have a cold spring there, and she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14872">"I should think so," said Zossimov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14875">"And did he beat her badly?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14878">"What does that matter!"  </span><span id="en14880">put in Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14883">"H'm!  </span><span id="en14885">But I don't know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother," said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14888">"Ah, my dear, I don't know what to talk about," broke from Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14891">"Why, are you all afraid of me?"  </span><span id="en14893">he asked, with a constrained smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14896">"That's certainly true," said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at her brother. " </span><span id="en14898">Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the stairs." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14901">His face worked, as though in convulsion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14904">"Ach, what are you saying, Dounia!  </span><span id="en14906">Don't be angry, please, Rodya....  </span><span id="en14908">Why did you say that, Dounia?"  </span><span id="en14910">Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, overwhelmed—"You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything together....  </span><span id="en14912">And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey!  </span><span id="en14914">But what am I saying?  </span><span id="en14916">I am happy now....  </span><span id="en14918">You should not, Dounia....  </span><span id="en14920">I am happy now—simply in seeing you, Rodya...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en14923">"Hush, mother," he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but pressing her hand. " </span><span id="en14925">We shall have time to speak freely of everything!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14928">As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned pale.  </span><span id="en14930">Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly chill over his soul.  </span><span id="en14931">Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had just told a fearful lie—that he would never now be able to speak freely of everything—that he would never again be able to  </span><i><span id="en14932">speak </span></i><span id="en14933">  </span><span id="en14934">of anything to anyone.  </span><span id="en14936">The anguish of this thought was such that for a moment he almost forgot himself.  </span><span id="en14938">He got up from his seat, and not looking at anyone walked towards the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14942">"What are you about?"  </span><span id="en14944">cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14947">He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence.  </span><span id="en14949">They were all looking at him in perplexity. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14952">"But what are you all so dull for?"  </span><span id="en14954">he shouted, suddenly and quite unexpectedly. " </span><span id="en14956">Do say something!  </span><span id="en14958">What's the use of sitting like this?  </span><span id="en14960">Come, do speak.  </span><span id="en14962">Let us talk....  </span><span id="en14964">We meet together and sit in silence....  </span><span id="en14966">Come, anything!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en14969">"Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again," said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14972">"What is the matter, Rodya?"  </span><span id="en14974">asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14977">"Oh, nothing!  </span><span id="en14979">I remembered something," he answered, and suddenly laughed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14982">"Well, if you remembered something; that's all right!...  </span><span id="en14984">I was beginning to think..."  </span><span id="en14986">muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. " </span><span id="en14988">It is time for me to be off.  </span><span id="en14990">I will look in again perhaps...  </span><span id="en14992">if I can..."  </span><span id="en14994">He made his bows, and went out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en14997">"What an excellent man!"  </span><span id="en14999">observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15002">"Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent," Raskolnikov began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he had not shown till then. " </span><span id="en15004">I can't remember where I met him before my illness....  </span><span id="en15006">I believe I have met him somewhere——...  </span><span id="en15008">And this is a good man, too," he nodded at Razumihin. " </span><span id="en15010">Do you like him, Dounia?"  </span><span id="en15012">he asked her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15015">"Very much," answered Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15018">"Foo! </span><span id="en15020">—what a pig you are!"  </span><span id="en15022">Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible confusion, and he got up from his chair.  </span><span id="en15024">Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15027">"Where are you off to?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15030">"I must go." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15033">"You need not at all.  </span><span id="en15035">Stay.  </span><span id="en15037">Zossimov has gone, so you must.  </span><span id="en15039">Don't go.  </span><span id="en15041">What's the time?  </span><span id="en15043">Is it twelve o'clock?  </span><span id="en15045">What a pretty watch you have got, Dounia.  </span><span id="en15047">But why are you all silent again?  </span><span id="en15049">I do all the talking." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15052">"It was a present from Marfa Petrovna," answered Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15055">"And a very expensive one!"  </span><span id="en15057">added Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15060">"A-ah!  </span><span id="en15062">What a big one!  </span><span id="en15064">Hardly like a lady's." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15067">"I like that sort," said Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15069">"So it is not a present from her  </span><i><span id="en15070">fiancé </span></i><span id="en15072">," thought Razumihin, and was unreasonably delighted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15076">"I thought it was Luzhin's present," observed Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15079">"No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15082">"A-ah!  </span><span id="en15084">And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get married?"  </span><span id="en15086">he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15089">"Oh, yes, my dear." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15092">Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15095">"H'm, yes.  </span><span id="en15097">What shall I tell you?  </span><span id="en15099">I don't remember much indeed.  </span><span id="en15101">She was such a sickly girl," he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again. " </span><span id="en15103">Quite an invalid.  </span><span id="en15105">She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she began talking to me about it.  </span><span id="en15107">Yes, yes, I remember.  </span><span id="en15109">I remember very well.  </span><span id="en15111">She was an ugly little thing.  </span><span id="en15113">I really don't know what drew me to her then—I think it was because she was always ill.  </span><span id="en15115">If she had been lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still," he smiled dreamily. " </span><span id="en15117">Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15120">"No, it was not only spring delirium," said Dounia, with warm feeling. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15123">He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did not understand her words.  </span><span id="en15125">Then, completely lost in thought, he got up, went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15128">"You love her even now?"  </span><span id="en15130">said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15133">"Her?  </span><span id="en15135">Now?  </span><span id="en15137">Oh, yes....  </span><span id="en15139">You ask about her?  </span><span id="en15141">No...  </span><span id="en15143">that's all now, as it were, in another world...  </span><span id="en15145">and so long ago.  </span><span id="en15147">And indeed everything happening here seems somehow far away."  </span><span id="en15149">He looked attentively at them. " </span><span id="en15151">You, now...  </span><span id="en15153">I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...  </span><span id="en15155">but, goodness knows why we are talking of that!  </span><span id="en15157">And what's the use of asking about it?"  </span><span id="en15159">he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell into dreamy silence again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15162">"What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya!  </span><span id="en15164">It's like a tomb," said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. " </span><span id="en15166">I am sure it's quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15169">"My lodging," he answered, listlessly. " </span><span id="en15171">Yes, the lodging had a great deal to do with it....  </span><span id="en15173">I thought that, too....  </span><span id="en15175">If only you knew, though, what a strange thing you said just now, mother," he said, laughing strangely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15178">A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister, with him after three years' absence, this intimate tone of conversation, in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything, would have been beyond his power of endurance.  </span><span id="en15180">But there was one urgent matter which must be settled one way or the other that day—so he had decided when he woke.  </span><span id="en15182">Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of escape. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15185">"Listen, Dounia," he began, gravely and drily, "of course I beg your pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that I do not withdraw from my chief point.  </span><span id="en15187">It is me or Luzhin.  </span><span id="en15189">If I am a scoundrel, you must not be.  </span><span id="en15191">One is enough.  </span><span id="en15193">If you marry Luzhin, I cease at once to look on you as a sister." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15196">"Rodya, Rodya!  </span><span id="en15198">It is the same as yesterday again," Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried, mournfully. " </span><span id="en15200">And why do you call yourself a scoundrel?  </span><span id="en15202">I can't bear it.  </span><span id="en15204">You said the same yesterday." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15207">"Brother," Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. " </span><span id="en15209">In all this there is a mistake on your part.  </span><span id="en15211">I thought it over at night, and found out the mistake.  </span><span id="en15213">It is all because you seem to fancy I am sacrificing myself to someone and for someone.  </span><span id="en15215">That is not the case at all.  </span><span id="en15217">I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for me.  </span><span id="en15219">Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to my family.  </span><span id="en15221">But that is not the chief motive for my decision...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15224">"She is lying," he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively. " </span><span id="en15226">Proud creature!  </span><span id="en15228">She won't admit she wants to do it out of charity!  </span><span id="en15230">Too haughty!  </span><span id="en15232">Oh, base characters!  </span><span id="en15234">They even love as though they hate....  </span><span id="en15236">Oh, how I...  </span><span id="en15238">hate them all!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15241">"In fact," continued Dounia, "I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of two evils I choose the less.  </span><span id="en15243">I intend to do honestly all he expects of me, so I am not deceiving him....  </span><span id="en15245">Why did you smile just now?"  </span><span id="en15247">She, too, flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15250">"All?"  </span><span id="en15252">he asked, with a malignant grin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15255">"Within certain limits.  </span><span id="en15257">Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch's courtship showed me at once what he wanted.  </span><span id="en15259">He may, of course, think too well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too....  </span><span id="en15261">Why are you laughing again?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15264">"And why are you blushing again?  </span><span id="en15266">You are lying, sister.  </span><span id="en15268">You are intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your own against me....  </span><span id="en15270">You cannot respect Luzhin.  </span><span id="en15272">I have seen him and talked with him.  </span><span id="en15274">So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15277">"It is not true.  </span><span id="en15279">I am not lying," cried Dounia, losing her composure. " </span><span id="en15281">I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me and thinks highly of me.  </span><span id="en15283">I would not marry him if I were not firmly convinced that I can respect him.  </span><span id="en15285">Fortunately, I can have convincing proof of it this very day...  </span><span id="en15287">and such a marriage is not a vileness, as you say!  </span><span id="en15289">And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?  </span><span id="en15291">Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either?  </span><span id="en15293">It is despotism; it is tyranny.  </span><span id="en15295">If I ruin anyone, it is only myself....  </span><span id="en15297">I am not committing a murder.  </span><span id="en15299">Why do you look at me like that?  </span><span id="en15301">Why are you so pale?  </span><span id="en15303">Rodya, darling, what's the matter?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15306">"Good heavens!  </span><span id="en15308">You have made him faint," cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15311">"No, no, nonsense!  </span><span id="en15313">It's nothing.  </span><span id="en15315">A little giddiness—not fainting.  </span><span id="en15317">You have fainting on the brain.  </span><span id="en15319">H'm, yes, what was I saying?  </span><span id="en15321">Oh, yes.  </span><span id="en15323">In what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him, and that he...  </span><span id="en15325">esteems you, as you said.  </span><span id="en15327">I think you said to-day?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15330">"Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch's letter," said Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15333">With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter.  </span><span id="en15335">He took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15338">"It is strange," he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. " </span><span id="en15340">What am I making such a fuss for?  </span><span id="en15342">What is it all about?  </span><span id="en15344">Marry whom you like!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15347">He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for some time at his sister, as though puzzled.  </span><span id="en15349">He opened the letter at last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face.  </span><span id="en15351">Then, slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.  </span><span id="en15353">Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected something particular. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15356">"What surprises me," he began, after a short pause, handing the letter to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, "is that he is a business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and yet he writes such an uneducated letter." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15359">They all started.  </span><span id="en15361">They had expected something quite different. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15364">"But they all write like that, you know," Razumihin observed, abruptly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15367">"Have you read it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15370">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15373">"We showed him, Rodya.  </span><span id="en15375">We...  </span><span id="en15377">consulted him just now," Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, embarrassed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15380">"That's just the jargon of the courts," Razumihin put in. " </span><span id="en15382">Legal documents are written like that to this day." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15385">"Legal?  </span><span id="en15387">Yes, it's just legal—business language—not so very uneducated, and not quite educated—business language!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15390">"Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way," Avdotya Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother's tone. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15393">"Well, if he's proud of it, he has reason, I don't deny it.  </span><span id="en15395">You seem to be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to annoy you.  </span><span id="en15397">It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand.  </span><span id="en15399">There is one expression, 'blame yourselves' put in very significantly and plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I am present.  </span><span id="en15401">That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning you to Petersburg.  </span><span id="en15403">Well, what do you think?  </span><span id="en15405">Can one resent such an expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15408">"N-no," answered Dounia, with more animation. " </span><span id="en15410">I saw clearly that it was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill in writing...  </span><span id="en15412">that is a true criticism, brother.  </span><span id="en15414">I did not expect, indeed..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15417">"It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he intended.  </span><span id="en15419">But I must disillusion you a little.  </span><span id="en15421">There is one expression in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one.  </span><span id="en15423">I gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed with trouble, and not 'on the pretext of the funeral,' but simply to pay for the funeral, and not to the daughter—a young woman, as he writes, of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my life)—but to the widow.  </span><span id="en15425">In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension between us.  </span><span id="en15427">It is expressed again in legal jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and with a very naïve eagerness.  </span><span id="en15429">He is a man of intelligence, but to act sensibly, intelligence is not enough.  </span><span id="en15431">It all shows the man and...  </span><span id="en15433">I don't think he has a great esteem for you.  </span><span id="en15435">I tell you this simply to warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15438">Dounia did not reply.  </span><span id="en15440">Her resolution had been taken.  </span><span id="en15442">She was only awaiting the evening. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15445">"Then what is your decision, Rodya?"  </span><span id="en15447">asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his talk. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15450">"What decision?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15453">"You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this evening, and that he will go away if you come.  </span><span id="en15455">So will you...  </span><span id="en15457">come?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15460">"That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is not offended.  </span><span id="en15462">I will do what you think best," he added, drily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15465">"Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15468">"I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at this interview," said Dounia. " </span><span id="en15470">Will you come?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15473">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15476">"I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o'clock," she said, addressing Razumihin. " </span><span id="en15478">Mother, I am inviting him, too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15481">"Quite right, Dounia.  </span><span id="en15483">Well, since you have decided," added Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "so be it.  </span><span id="en15485">I shall feel easier myself.  </span><span id="en15487">I do not like concealment and deception.  </span><span id="en15489">Better let us have the whole truth....  </span><span id="en15491">Pyotr Petrovitch may be angry or not, now!" </span></p>

<p><span id="en15495">At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into the room, looking timidly about her.  </span><span id="en15497">Everyone turned towards her with surprise and curiosity.  </span><span id="en15499">At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise her.  </span><span id="en15501">It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov.  </span><span id="en15503">He had seen her yesterday for the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her.  </span><span id="en15505">Now she was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed, almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but somewhat frightened-looking face.  </span><span id="en15507">She was wearing a very plain indoor dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a parasol.  </span><span id="en15509">Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child.  </span><span id="en15511">She was even about to retreat. " </span><span id="en15513">Oh...  </span><span id="en15515">it's you!"  </span><span id="en15517">said Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused.  </span><span id="en15519">He at once recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin's letter of "some young woman of notorious behaviour."  </span><span id="en15521">He had only just been protesting against Luzhin's calumny and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in.  </span><span id="en15523">He remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression "of notorious behaviour."  </span><span id="en15525">All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her.  </span><span id="en15527">When she made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15530">"I did not expect you," he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her stop. " </span><span id="en15532">Please sit down.  </span><span id="en15534">You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.  </span><span id="en15536">Allow me—not there.  </span><span id="en15538">Sit here...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15541">At Sonia's entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of Raskolnikov's three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to enter.  </span><span id="en15542">Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed, was too  </span><i><span id="en15543">familiar </span></i><span id="en15544">  </span><span id="en15545">a place, he hurriedly motioned her to Razumihin's chair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15549">"You sit here," he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15552">Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the two ladies.  </span><span id="en15554">It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them.  </span><span id="en15556">At the thought of it, she was so frightened that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15559">"I...  </span><span id="en15561">I...  </span><span id="en15563">have come for one minute.  </span><span id="en15565">Forgive me for disturbing you," she began falteringly. " </span><span id="en15567">I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to send.  </span><span id="en15569">Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you...  </span><span id="en15571">to be at the service...  </span><span id="en15573">in the morning...  </span><span id="en15575">at Mitrofanievsky...  </span><span id="en15577">and then...  </span><span id="en15579">to us...  </span><span id="en15581">to her...  </span><span id="en15583">to do her the honour...  </span><span id="en15585">she told me to beg you..."  </span><span id="en15587">Sonia stammered and ceased speaking. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15590">"I will try, certainly, most certainly," answered Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en15592">He, too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence. " </span><span id="en15594">Please sit down," he said, suddenly. " </span><span id="en15596">I want to talk to you.  </span><span id="en15598">You are perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes," and he drew up a chair for her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15601">Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes.  </span><span id="en15603">Raskolnikov's pale face flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15606">"Mother," he said, firmly and insistently, "this is Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr.  </span><span id="en15608">Marmeladov, who was run over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15611">Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up her eyes.  </span><span id="en15613">In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya's urgent and challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction.  </span><span id="en15615">Dounia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl's face, and scrutinised her with perplexity.  </span><span id="en15617">Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15620">"I wanted to ask you," said Raskolnikov, hastily, "how things were arranged yesterday.  </span><span id="en15622">You were not worried by the police, for instance?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15625">"No, that was all right...  </span><span id="en15627">it was too evident, the cause of death...  </span><span id="en15629">they did not worry us...  </span><span id="en15631">only the lodgers are angry." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15634">"Why?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15637">"At the body's remaining so long.  </span><span id="en15639">You see it is hot now.  </span><span id="en15641">So that, to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until to-morrow.  </span><span id="en15643">At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees herself that it's necessary..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15646">"To-day, then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15649">"She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the service, and then to be present at the funeral lunch." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15652">"She is giving a funeral lunch?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15655">"Yes...  </span><span id="en15657">just a little....  </span><span id="en15659">She told me to thank you very much for helping us yesterday.  </span><span id="en15661">But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15664">All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she controlled herself, looking down again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15667">During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully.  </span><span id="en15669">She had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a sharp little nose and chin.  </span><span id="en15671">She could not have been called pretty, but her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted.  </span><span id="en15673">Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another peculiar characteristic.  </span><span id="en15675">In spite of her eighteen years, she looked almost a little girl—almost a child.  </span><span id="en15677">And in some of her gestures, this childishness seemed almost absurd. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15680">"But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?  </span><span id="en15682">Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch?"  </span><span id="en15684">Raskolnikov asked, persistently keeping up the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15687">"The coffin will be plain, of course...  </span><span id="en15689">and everything will be plain, so it won't cost much.  </span><span id="en15691">Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so that there will be enough left...  </span><span id="en15693">and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious it should be so.  </span><span id="en15695">You know one can't...  </span><span id="en15697">it's a comfort to her...  </span><span id="en15699">she is like that, you know...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15702">"I understand, I understand...  </span><span id="en15704">of course...  </span><span id="en15706">why do you look at my room like that?  </span><span id="en15708">My mother has just said it is like a tomb." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15711">"You gave us everything yesterday," Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion.  </span><span id="en15713">Her lips and chin were trembling once more.  </span><span id="en15715">She had been struck at once by Raskolnikov's poor surroundings, and now these words broke out spontaneously.  </span><span id="en15717">A silence followed.  </span><span id="en15719">There was a light in Dounia's eyes, and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15722">"Rodya," she said, getting up, "we shall have dinner together, of course.  </span><span id="en15724">Come, Dounia....  </span><span id="en15726">And you, Rodya, had better go for a little walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us....  </span><span id="en15728">I am afraid we have exhausted you...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15731">"Yes, yes, I'll come," he answered, getting up fussily. " </span><span id="en15733">But I have something to see to." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15736">"But surely you will have dinner together?"  </span><span id="en15738">cried Razumihin, looking in surprise at Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en15740">What do you mean?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15743">"Yes, yes, I am coming...  </span><span id="en15745">of course, of course!  </span><span id="en15747">And you stay a minute.  </span><span id="en15749">You do not want him just now, do you, mother?  </span><span id="en15751">Or perhaps I am taking him from you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15754">"Oh, no, no.  </span><span id="en15756">And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining with us?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15759">"Please do," added Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15762">Razumihin bowed, positively radiant.  </span><span id="en15764">For one moment, they were all strangely embarrassed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15767">"Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet.  </span><span id="en15769">I do not like saying good-bye.  </span><span id="en15771">Good-bye, Nastasya.  </span><span id="en15773">Ah, I have said good-bye again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15776">Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15779">But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow.  </span><span id="en15781">Sonia, in confusion, gave a hurried, frightened curtsy.  </span><span id="en15783">There was a look of poignant discomfort in her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna's courtesy and attention were oppressive and painful to her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15786">"Dounia, good-bye," called Raskolnikov, in the passage. " </span><span id="en15788">Give me your hand." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15791">"Why, I did give it to you.  </span><span id="en15793">Have you forgotten?"  </span><span id="en15795">said Dounia, turning warmly and awkwardly to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15798">"Never mind, give it to me again."  </span><span id="en15800">And he squeezed her fingers warmly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15803">Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15806">"Come, that's capital," he said to Sonia, going back and looking brightly at her. " </span><span id="en15808">God give peace to the dead, the living have still to live.  </span><span id="en15810">That is right, isn't it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15813">Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face.  </span><span id="en15815">He looked at her for some moments in silence.  </span><span id="en15817">The whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moments.... </span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en15820">"Heavens, Dounia," Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in the street, "I really feel relieved myself at coming away—more at ease.  </span><span id="en15822">How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad of that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15825">"I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill.  </span><span id="en15827">Don't you see it?  </span><span id="en15829">Perhaps worrying about us upset him.  </span><span id="en15831">We must be patient, and much, much can be forgiven." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15834">"Well, you were not very patient!"  </span><span id="en15836">Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up, hotly and jealously. " </span><span id="en15838">Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two.  </span><span id="en15840">You are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul.  </span><span id="en15842">You are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both generous....  </span><span id="en15844">Surely he can't be an egoist, Dounia.  </span><span id="en15846">Eh?  </span><span id="en15848">When I think of what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15851">"Don't be uneasy, mother.  </span><span id="en15853">What must be, will be." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15856">"Dounia, only think what a position we are in!  </span><span id="en15858">What if Pyotr Petrovitch breaks it off?"  </span><span id="en15860">poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15863">"He won't be worth much if he does," answered Dounia, sharply and contemptuously. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15866">"We did well to come away," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in. " </span><span id="en15868">He was in a hurry about some business or other.  </span><span id="en15870">If he gets out and has a breath of air...  </span><span id="en15872">it is fearfully close in his room....  </span><span id="en15874">But where is one to get a breath of air here?  </span><span id="en15876">The very streets here feel like shut-up rooms.  </span><span id="en15878">Good heavens!  </span><span id="en15880">what a town!...  </span><span id="en15882">stay...  </span><span id="en15884">this side...  </span><span id="en15886">they will crush you—carrying something.  </span><span id="en15888">Why, it is a piano they have got, I declare...  </span><span id="en15890">how they push!...  </span><span id="en15892">I am very much afraid of that young woman, too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15895">"What young woman, mother? </span></p>
<p><span id="en15898">"Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15901">"Why?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15904">"I have a presentiment, Dounia.  </span><span id="en15906">Well, you may believe it or not, but as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief cause of the trouble...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15909">"Nothing of the sort!"  </span><span id="en15911">cried Dounia, in vexation. " </span><span id="en15913">What nonsense, with your presentiments, mother!  </span><span id="en15915">He only made her acquaintance the evening before, and he did not know her when she came in." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15918">"Well, you will see....  </span><span id="en15920">She worries me; but you will see, you will see!  </span><span id="en15922">I was so frightened.  </span><span id="en15924">She was gazing at me with those eyes.  </span><span id="en15926">I could scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you remember?  </span><span id="en15928">It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that about her, and he introduces her to us—to you!  </span><span id="en15930">So he must think a great deal of her." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15933">"People will write anything.  </span><span id="en15935">We were talked about and written about, too.  </span><span id="en15937">Have you forgotten?  </span><span id="en15939">I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it is all nonsense." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15942">"God grant it may be!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15945">"And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer," Dounia snapped out, suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15948">Pulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed. </span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en15951">"I will tell you what I want with you," said Raskolnikov, drawing Razumihin to the window. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15954">"Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming," Sonia said hurriedly, preparing to depart. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15957">"One minute, Sofya Semyonovna.  </span><span id="en15959">We have no secrets.  </span><span id="en15961">You are not in our way.  </span><span id="en15963">I want to have another word or two with you.  </span><span id="en15965">Listen!"  </span><span id="en15967">he turned suddenly to Razumihin again. " </span><span id="en15969">You know that...  </span><span id="en15971">what's his name...  </span><span id="en15973">Porfiry Petrovitch?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en15976">"I should think so!  </span><span id="en15978">He is a relation.  </span><span id="en15980">Why?"  </span><span id="en15982">added the latter, with interest. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15985">"Is not he managing that case...  </span><span id="en15987">you know, about that murder?...  </span><span id="en15989">You were speaking about it yesterday." </span></p>
<p><span id="en15992">"Yes...  </span><span id="en15994">well?"  </span><span id="en15996">Razumihin's eyes opened wide. </span></p>
<p><span id="en15999">"He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some pledges there, too—trifles—a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when I left home, and my father's silver watch—they are only worth five or six roubles altogether...  </span><span id="en16001">but I value them.  </span><span id="en16003">So what am I to do now?  </span><span id="en16005">I do not want to lose the things, especially the watch.  </span><span id="en16007">I was quaking just now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia's watch.  </span><span id="en16009">It is the only thing of father's left us.  </span><span id="en16011">She would be ill if it were lost.  </span><span id="en16013">You know what women are.  </span><span id="en16015">So tell me what to do.  </span><span id="en16017">I know I ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be better to go straight to Porfiry?  </span><span id="en16019">Eh?  </span><span id="en16021">What do you think?  </span><span id="en16023">The matter might be settled more quickly.  </span><span id="en16025">You see, mother may ask for it before dinner." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16028">"Certainly not to the police station.  </span><span id="en16030">Certainly to Porfiry," Razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement. " </span><span id="en16032">Well, how glad I am.  </span><span id="en16034">Let us go at once.  </span><span id="en16036">It is a couple of steps.  </span><span id="en16038">We shall be sure to find him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16041">"Very well, let us go." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16044">"And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance.  </span><span id="en16046">I have often talked to him of you at different times.  </span><span id="en16048">I was speaking of you yesterday.  </span><span id="en16050">Let us go.  </span><span id="en16052">So you knew the old woman?  </span><span id="en16054">So that's it!  </span><span id="en16056">It is all turning out splendidly....  </span><span id="en16058">Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16061">"Sofya Semyonovna," corrected Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en16063">Sofya Semyonovna, this is my friend Razumihin, and he is a good man." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16066">"If you have to go now," Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin at all, and still more embarrassed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16069">"Let us go," decided Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en16071">I will come to you to-day, Sofya Semyonovna.  </span><span id="en16073">Only tell me where you live." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16076">He was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her eyes.  </span><span id="en16078">Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so.  </span><span id="en16080">They all went out together. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16083">"Don't you lock up?"  </span><span id="en16085">asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16088">"Never," answered Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en16090">I have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years.  </span><span id="en16092">People are happy who have no need of locks," he said, laughing, to Sonia.  </span><span id="en16094">They stood still in the gateway. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16097">"Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna?  </span><span id="en16099">How did you find me, by the way?"  </span><span id="en16101">he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different.  </span><span id="en16103">He wanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16106">"Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16109">"Polenka?  </span><span id="en16111">Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl.  </span><span id="en16113">She is your sister?  </span><span id="en16115">Did I give her the address?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16118">"Why, had you forgotten?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16121">"No, I remember." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16124">"I had heard my father speak of you...  </span><span id="en16126">only I did not know your name, and he did not know it.  </span><span id="en16128">And now I came...  </span><span id="en16130">and as I had learnt your name, I asked to-day, 'Where does Mr.  </span><span id="en16132">Raskolnikov live? </span><span id="en16134">' I did not know you had only a room too....  </span><span id="en16136">Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16139">She was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down, hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to remember, to meditate on every word, every detail.  </span><span id="en16141">Never, never had she felt anything like this.  </span><span id="en16143">Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was opening before her.  </span><span id="en16145">She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to come to her that day, perhaps at once! </span></p>
<p><span id="en16148">"Only not to-day, please, not to-day!"  </span><span id="en16150">she kept muttering with a sinking heart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child. " </span><span id="en16152">Mercy!  </span><span id="en16154">to me...  </span><span id="en16156">to that room...  </span><span id="en16158">he will see...  </span><span id="en16160">oh, dear!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16163">She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who was watching her and following at her heels.  </span><span id="en16165">He had accompanied her from the gateway.  </span><span id="en16167">At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing, started on hearing Sonia's words: "and I asked where Mr.  </span><span id="en16169">Raskolnikov lived?"  </span><span id="en16171">He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted the house.  </span><span id="en16173">All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for something.  </span><span id="en16175">He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and that Sonia was going home. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16178">"Home?  </span><span id="en16180">Where?  </span><span id="en16182">I've seen that face somewhere," he thought. " </span><span id="en16184">I must find out." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16187">At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the same way, noticing nothing.  </span><span id="en16189">She turned the corner.  </span><span id="en16191">He followed her on the other side.  </span><span id="en16193">After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook her and kept two or three yards behind her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16196">He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little.  </span><span id="en16198">He wore good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.  </span><span id="en16200">He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each step; his gloves were spotless.  </span><span id="en16202">He had a broad, rather pleasant face with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.  </span><span id="en16204">His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.  </span><span id="en16206">His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were crimson.  </span><span id="en16208">He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger than his years. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16211">When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on the pavement.  </span><span id="en16213">He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation.  </span><span id="en16215">On reaching the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed her, seeming rather surprised.  </span><span id="en16217">In the courtyard she turned to the right corner. " </span><span id="en16219">Bah!"  </span><span id="en16221">muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs behind her.  </span><span id="en16223">Only then Sonia noticed him.  </span><span id="en16225">She reached the third storey, turned down the passage, and rang at No.  </span><span id="en16227">9.  </span><span id="en16229">On the door was inscribed in chalk, "Kapernaumov, Tailor." " </span><span id="en16231">Bah!"  </span><span id="en16233">the stranger repeated again, wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No.  </span><span id="en16235">8.  </span><span id="en16237">The doors were two or three yards apart. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16240">"You lodge at Kapernaumov's," he said, looking at Sonia and laughing. " </span><span id="en16242">He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday.  </span><span id="en16244">I am staying close here at Madame Resslich's.  </span><span id="en16246">How odd!"  </span><span id="en16248">Sonia looked at him attentively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16251">"We are neighbours," he went on gaily. " </span><span id="en16253">I only came to town the day before yesterday.  </span><span id="en16255">Good-bye for the present." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16258">Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in.  </span><span id="en16260">She felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy. </span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en16263">On the way to Porfiry's, Razumihin was obviously excited. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16266">"That's capital, brother," he repeated several times, "and I am glad!  </span><span id="en16268">I am glad!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16271">"What are you glad about?"  </span><span id="en16273">Raskolnikov thought to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16276">"I didn't know that you pledged things at the old woman's, too.  </span><span id="en16278">And...  </span><span id="en16280">was it long ago?  </span><span id="en16282">I mean, was it long since you were there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16285">"What a simple-hearted fool he is!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16288">"When was it?"  </span><span id="en16290">Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. " </span><span id="en16292">Two or three days before her death it must have been.  </span><span id="en16294">But I am not going to redeem the things now," he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things. " </span><span id="en16296">I've not more than a silver rouble left...  </span><span id="en16298">after last night's accursed delirium!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16301">He laid special emphasis on the delirium. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16304">"Yes, yes," Razumihin hastened to agree—with what was not clear. " </span><span id="en16306">Then that's why you...  </span><span id="en16308">were stuck...  </span><span id="en16310">partly...  </span><span id="en16312">you know in your delirium you were continually mentioning some rings or chains!  </span><span id="en16314">Yes, yes...  </span><span id="en16316">that's clear, it's all clear now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16319">"Hullo!  </span><span id="en16321">How that idea must have got about among them.  </span><span id="en16322">Here this man will go to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it  </span><i><span id="en16323">cleared up </span></i><span id="en16324">  </span><span id="en16325">why I spoke of rings in my delirium!  </span><span id="en16327">What a hold the idea must have on all of them!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16331">"Shall we find him?"  </span><span id="en16333">he asked suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16336">"Oh, yes," Razumihin answered quickly. " </span><span id="en16338">He is a nice fellow, you will see, brother.  </span><span id="en16340">Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense.  </span><span id="en16342">He is an intelligent fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas....  </span><span id="en16344">He is incredulous, sceptical, cynical...  </span><span id="en16346">he likes to impose on people, or rather to make fun of them.  </span><span id="en16348">His is the old, circumstantial method....  </span><span id="en16350">But he understands his work...  </span><span id="en16352">thoroughly....  </span><span id="en16354">Last year he cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue.  </span><span id="en16356">He is very, very anxious to make your acquaintance!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16359">"On what grounds is he so anxious?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16362">"Oh, it's not exactly...  </span><span id="en16364">you see, since you've been ill I happen to have mentioned you several times....  </span><span id="en16366">So, when he heard about you...  </span><span id="en16368">about your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said, 'What a pity! </span><span id="en16370">' And so I concluded...  </span><span id="en16372">from everything together, not only that; yesterday Zametov...  </span><span id="en16374">you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk...  </span><span id="en16376">I am afraid, brother, of your exaggerating it, you see." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16379">"What?  </span><span id="en16381">That they think I am a madman?  </span><span id="en16383">Maybe they are right," he said with a constrained smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16386">"Yes, yes....  </span><span id="en16388">That is, pooh, no!...  </span><span id="en16390">But all that I said (and there was something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16393">"But why are you apologising?  </span><span id="en16395">I am so sick of it all!"  </span><span id="en16397">Raskolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability.  </span><span id="en16399">It was partly assumed, however. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16402">"I know, I know, I understand.  </span><span id="en16404">Believe me, I understand.  </span><span id="en16406">One's ashamed to speak of it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16409">"If you are ashamed, then don't speak of it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16412">Both were silent.  </span><span id="en16414">Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov perceived it with repulsion.  </span><span id="en16416">He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had just said about Porfiry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16419">"I shall have to pull a long face with him too," he thought, with a beating heart, and he turned white, "and do it naturally, too.  </span><span id="en16421">But the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all.  </span><span id="en16423">Carefully do nothing at all!  </span><span id="en16424">No,  </span><i><span id="en16425">carefully </span></i><span id="en16426">  </span><span id="en16427">would not be natural again....  </span><span id="en16429">Oh, well, we shall see how it turns out....  </span><span id="en16431">We shall see...  </span><span id="en16433">directly.  </span><span id="en16435">Is it a good thing to go or not?  </span><span id="en16437">The butterfly flies to the light.  </span><span id="en16439">My heart is beating, that's what's bad!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16443">"In this grey house," said Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16446">"The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old hag's flat yesterday...  </span><span id="en16448">and asked about the blood?  </span><span id="en16450">I must find that out instantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise...  </span><span id="en16452">I'll find out, if it's my ruin." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16455">"I say, brother," he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly smile, "I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously excited.  </span><span id="en16457">Isn't it so?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16460">"Excited?  </span><span id="en16462">Not a bit of it," said Razumihin, stung to the quick. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16465">"Yes, brother, I assure you it's noticeable.  </span><span id="en16467">Why, you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be writhing all the time.  </span><span id="en16469">You kept jumping up for nothing.  </span><span id="en16471">One moment you were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat.  </span><span id="en16473">You even blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed awfully." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16476">"Nothing of the sort, nonsense!  </span><span id="en16478">What do you mean?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16481">"But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy?  </span><span id="en16483">By Jove, there he's blushing again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16486">"What a pig you are!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16489">"But why are you so shamefaced about it?  </span><span id="en16491">Romeo!  </span><span id="en16493">Stay, I'll tell of you to-day.  </span><span id="en16495">Ha-ha-ha!  </span><span id="en16497">I'll make mother laugh, and someone else, too..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16500">"Listen, listen, listen, this is serious....  </span><span id="en16502">What next, you fiend!"  </span><span id="en16504">Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. " </span><span id="en16506">What will you tell them?  </span><span id="en16508">Come, brother...  </span><span id="en16510">foo!  </span><span id="en16512">what a pig you are!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16515">"You are like a summer rose.  </span><span id="en16517">And if only you knew how it suits you; a Romeo over six foot high!  </span><span id="en16519">And how you've washed to-day—you cleaned your nails, I declare.  </span><span id="en16521">Eh?  </span><span id="en16523">That's something unheard of!  </span><span id="en16525">Why, I do believe you've got pomatum on your hair!  </span><span id="en16527">Bend down." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16530">"Pig!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16533">Raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself.  </span><span id="en16535">So laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch's flat.  </span><span id="en16537">This is what Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they came in, still guffawing in the passage. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16540">"Not a word here or I'll...  </span><span id="en16542">brain you!"  </span><span id="en16544">Razumihin whispered furiously, seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder. </span></p>

<p><span id="en16548">Raskolnikov was already entering the room.  </span><span id="en16550">He came in looking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again.  </span><span id="en16552">Behind him Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression.  </span><span id="en16554">His face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified Raskolnikov's laughter.  </span><span id="en16556">Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction, bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them.  </span><span id="en16558">He held out his hand and shook hands, still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself.  </span><span id="en16560">But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself: his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to restrain it.  </span><span id="en16562">The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received this "spontaneous" mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness.  </span><span id="en16564">Razumihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16567">"Fool!  </span><span id="en16569">You fiend," he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on it.  </span><span id="en16571">Everything was sent flying and crashing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16574">"But why break chairs, gentlemen?  </span><span id="en16576">You know it's a loss to the Crown," Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16579">Raskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch's, but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural end to it.  </span><span id="en16581">Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.  </span><span id="en16583">Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations.  </span><span id="en16585">Zametov had been sitting in the corner, but he rose at the visitors' entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment.  </span><span id="en16587">Zametov's unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16590">"I've got to think of that," he thought. " </span><span id="en16592">Excuse me, please," he began, affecting extreme embarrassment. " </span><span id="en16594">Raskolnikov." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16597">"Not at all, very pleasant to see you...  </span><span id="en16599">and how pleasantly you've come in....  </span><span id="en16601">Why, won't he even say good-morning?"  </span><span id="en16603">Porfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16606">"Upon my honour I don't know why he is in such a rage with me.  </span><span id="en16608">I only told him as we came along that he was like Romeo...  </span><span id="en16610">and proved it.  </span><span id="en16612">And that was all, I think!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16615">"Pig!"  </span><span id="en16617">ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16620">"There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at the word," Porfiry laughed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16623">"Oh, you sharp lawyer!...  </span><span id="en16625">Damn you all!"  </span><span id="en16627">snapped Razumihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing had happened. " </span><span id="en16629">That'll do!  </span><span id="en16631">We are all fools.  </span><span id="en16633">To come to business.  </span><span id="en16635">This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with you.  </span><span id="en16637">Bah!  </span><span id="en16639">Zametov, what brought you here?  </span><span id="en16641">Have you met before?  </span><span id="en16643">Have you known each other long?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16646">"What does this mean?"  </span><span id="en16648">thought Raskolnikov uneasily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16651">Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16654">"Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday," he said easily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16657">"Then I have been spared the trouble.  </span><span id="en16659">All last week he was begging me to introduce him to you.  </span><span id="en16661">Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out without me.  </span><span id="en16663">Where is your tobacco?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16666">Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and trodden-down slippers.  </span><span id="en16668">He was a man of about five and thirty, short, stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven.  </span><span id="en16670">He wore his hair cut short and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back.  </span><span id="en16672">His soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression.  </span><span id="en16674">It would have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes.  </span><span id="en16676">The expression of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16679">As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity.  </span><span id="en16681">But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.  </span><span id="en16683">Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him.  </span><span id="en16685">Razumihin, sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently, looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16688">"Fool," Raskolnikov swore to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16691">"You have to give information to the police," Porfiry replied, with a most businesslike air, "that having learnt of this incident, that is of the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...  </span><span id="en16693">or...  </span><span id="en16695">but they will write to you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16698">"That's just the point, that at the present moment," Raskolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment, "I am not quite in funds...  </span><span id="en16700">and even this trifling sum is beyond me...  </span><span id="en16702">I only wanted, you see, for the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have money...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16705">"That's no matter," answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, "but you can, if you prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16708">"On an ordinary sheet of paper?"  </span><span id="en16710">Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the question. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16713">"Oh, the most ordinary," and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at him.  </span><span id="en16715">But perhaps it was Raskolnikov's fancy, for it all lasted but a moment.  </span><span id="en16717">There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16720">"He knows," flashed through his mind like lightning. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16723">"Forgive my troubling you about such trifles," he went on, a little disconcerted, "the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must confess that I was alarmed when I heard..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16726">"That's why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!"  </span><span id="en16728">Razumihin put in with obvious intention. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16731">This was really unbearable.  </span><span id="en16733">Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately recollected himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16736">"You seem to be jeering at me, brother?"  </span><span id="en16738">he said to him, with a well-feigned irritability. " </span><span id="en16740">I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn't think me selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes.  </span><span id="en16742">I told you just now that the silver watch, though it's not worth a cent, is the only thing left us of my father's.  </span><span id="en16744">You may laugh at me, but my mother is here," he turned suddenly to Porfiry, "and if she knew," he turned again hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, "that the watch was lost, she would be in despair!  </span><span id="en16746">You know what women are!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16749">"Not a bit of it!  </span><span id="en16751">I didn't mean that at all!  </span><span id="en16753">Quite the contrary!"  </span><span id="en16755">shouted Razumihin distressed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16758">"Was it right?  </span><span id="en16760">Was it natural?  </span><span id="en16762">Did I overdo it?"  </span><span id="en16764">Raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor. " </span><span id="en16766">Why did I say that about women?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16769">"Oh, your mother is with you?"  </span><span id="en16771">Porfiry Petrovitch inquired. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16774">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16777">"When did she come?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16780">"Last night." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16783">Porfiry paused as though reflecting. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16786">"Your things would not in any case be lost," he went on calmly and coldly. " </span><span id="en16788">I have been expecting you here for some time." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16791">And as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet.  </span><span id="en16793">Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin's cigarette. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16796">"What?  </span><span id="en16798">Expecting him?  </span><span id="en16799">Why, did you know that he had pledges  </span><i><span id="en16800">there </span></i><span id="en16802">?" cried Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16806">Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16809">"Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the date on which you left them with her..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16812">"How observant you are!"  </span><span id="en16813">Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly added: </span></p>
<p><span id="en16815">"I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges...  </span><span id="en16817">that it must be difficult to remember them all....  </span><span id="en16819">But you remember them all so clearly, and...  </span><span id="en16821">and..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16824">"Stupid!  </span><span id="en16826">Feeble!"  </span><span id="en16828">he thought. " </span><span id="en16830">Why did I add that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16833">"But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn't come forward," Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16836">"I haven't been quite well." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16839">"I heard that too.  </span><span id="en16841">I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress about something.  </span><span id="en16843">You look pale still." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16846">"I am not pale at all....  </span><span id="en16848">No, I am quite well," Raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone.  </span><span id="en16850">His anger was mounting, he could not repress it. " </span><span id="en16852">And in my anger I shall betray myself," flashed through his mind again. " </span><span id="en16854">Why are they torturing me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16857">"Not quite well!"  </span><span id="en16859">Razumihin caught him up. " </span><span id="en16861">What next!  </span><span id="en16863">He was unconscious and delirious all yesterday.  </span><span id="en16865">Would you believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious all the time!  </span><span id="en16867">Would you believe it!  </span><span id="en16869">Extraordinary!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16872">"Really delirious?  </span><span id="en16874">You don't say so!"  </span><span id="en16876">Porfiry shook his head in a womanish way. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16879">"Nonsense!  </span><span id="en16881">Don't you believe it!  </span><span id="en16883">But you don't believe it anyway," Raskolnikov let slip in his anger.  </span><span id="en16885">But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem to catch those strange words. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16888">"But how could you have gone out if you hadn't been delirious?"  </span><span id="en16890">Razumihin got hot suddenly. " </span><span id="en16892">What did you go out for?  </span><span id="en16894">What was the object of it?  </span><span id="en16896">And why on the sly?  </span><span id="en16898">Were you in your senses when you did it?  </span><span id="en16900">Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16903">"I was awfully sick of them yesterday."  </span><span id="en16905">Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, "I ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn't find me, and took a lot of money with me.  </span><span id="en16907">Mr.  </span><span id="en16909">Zametov there saw it.  </span><span id="en16911">I say, Mr.  </span><span id="en16913">Zametov, was I sensible or delirious yesterday; settle our dispute." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16916">He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his expression and his silence to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16919">"In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were extremely irritable," Zametov pronounced dryly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16922">"And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day," put in Porfiry Petrovitch, "that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16925">"And there," said Razumihin, "weren't you mad then?  </span><span id="en16927">You gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral.  </span><span id="en16929">If you wanted to help, give fifteen or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he flung away all the twenty-five at once!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16932">"Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it?  </span><span id="en16934">So that's why I was liberal yesterday....  </span><span id="en16936">Mr.  </span><span id="en16938">Zametov knows I've found a treasure!  </span><span id="en16940">Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities," he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips. " </span><span id="en16942">We are boring you, aren't we?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16945">"Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary!  </span><span id="en16947">If only you knew how you interest me!  </span><span id="en16949">It's interesting to look on and listen...  </span><span id="en16951">and I am really glad you have come forward at last." </span></p>
<p><span id="en16954">"But you might give us some tea!  </span><span id="en16956">My throat's dry," cried Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16959">"Capital idea!  </span><span id="en16961">Perhaps we will all keep you company.  </span><span id="en16963">Wouldn't you like...  </span><span id="en16965">something more essential before tea?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16968">"Get along with you!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en16971">Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16974">Raskolnikov's thoughts were in a whirl.  </span><span id="en16976">He was in terrible exasperation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en16979">"The worst of it is they don't disguise it; they don't care to stand on ceremony!  </span><span id="en16981">And how if you didn't know me at all, did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me?  </span><span id="en16983">So they don't care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dogs.  </span><span id="en16985">They simply spit in my face."  </span><span id="en16987">He was shaking with rage. " </span><span id="en16989">Come, strike me openly, don't play with me like a cat with a mouse.  </span><span id="en16991">It's hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I won't allow it!  </span><span id="en16993">I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces, and you'll see how I despise you."  </span><span id="en16995">He could hardly breathe. " </span><span id="en16997">And what if it's only my fancy?  </span><span id="en16999">What if I am mistaken, and through inexperience I get angry and don't keep up my nasty part?  </span><span id="en17001">Perhaps it's all unintentional.  </span><span id="en17003">All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is something about them....  </span><span id="en17005">It all might be said, but there is something.  </span><span id="en17007">Why did he say bluntly, 'With her'?  </span><span id="en17009">Why did Zametov add that I spoke artfully?  </span><span id="en17011">Why do they speak in that tone?  </span><span id="en17013">Yes, the tone....  </span><span id="en17015">Razumihin is sitting here, why does he see nothing?  </span><span id="en17017">That innocent blockhead never does see anything!  </span><span id="en17019">Feverish again!  </span><span id="en17021">Did Porfiry wink at me just now?  </span><span id="en17023">Of course it's nonsense!  </span><span id="en17025">What could he wink for?  </span><span id="en17027">Are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me?  </span><span id="en17029">Either it's ill fancy or they know!  </span><span id="en17031">Even Zametov is rude....  </span><span id="en17033">Is Zametov rude?  </span><span id="en17035">Zametov has changed his mind.  </span><span id="en17037">I foresaw he would change his mind!  </span><span id="en17039">He is at home here, while it's my first visit.  </span><span id="en17041">Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back to him.  </span><span id="en17043">They're as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me!  </span><span id="en17045">Not a doubt they were talking about me before we came.  </span><span id="en17047">Do they know about the flat?  </span><span id="en17049">If only they'd make haste!  </span><span id="en17051">When I said that I ran away to take a flat he let it pass....  </span><span id="en17053">I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use afterwards....  </span><span id="en17055">Delirious, indeed...  </span><span id="en17057">ha-ha-ha!  </span><span id="en17059">He knows all about last night!  </span><span id="en17061">He didn't know of my mother's arrival!  </span><span id="en17063">The hag had written the date on in pencil!  </span><span id="en17065">You are wrong, you won't catch me!  </span><span id="en17067">There are no facts...  </span><span id="en17069">it's all supposition!  </span><span id="en17071">You produce facts!  </span><span id="en17073">The flat even isn't a fact but delirium.  </span><span id="en17075">I know what to say to them....  </span><span id="en17077">Do they know about the flat?  </span><span id="en17079">I won't go without finding out.  </span><span id="en17081">What did I come for?  </span><span id="en17083">But my being angry now, maybe is a fact!  </span><span id="en17085">Fool, how irritable I am!  </span><span id="en17087">Perhaps that's right; to play the invalid....  </span><span id="en17089">He is feeling me.  </span><span id="en17091">He will try to catch me.  </span><span id="en17093">Why did I come?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17096">All this flashed like lightning through his mind. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17099">Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly.  </span><span id="en17101">He became suddenly more jovial. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17104">"Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather....  </span><span id="en17106">And I am out of sorts altogether," he began in quite a different tone, laughing to Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17109">"Was it interesting?  </span><span id="en17111">I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.  </span><span id="en17113">Who got the best of it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17116">"Oh, no one, of course.  </span><span id="en17118">They got on to everlasting questions, floated off into space." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17121">"Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday.  </span><span id="en17123">Whether there is such a thing as crime.  </span><span id="en17125">I told you that we talked our heads off." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17128">"What is there strange?  </span><span id="en17130">It's an everyday social question," Raskolnikov answered casually. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17133">"The question wasn't put quite like that," observed Porfiry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17136">"Not quite, that's true," Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and hurried as usual. " </span><span id="en17138">Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to hear it.  </span><span id="en17140">I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me.  </span><span id="en17142">I told them you were coming....  </span><span id="en17144">It began with the socialist doctrine.  </span><span id="en17146">You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more; no other causes admitted!..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17149">"You are wrong there," cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him more excited than ever. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17152">"Nothing is admitted," Razumihin interrupted with heat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17155">"I am not wrong.  </span><span id="en17157">I'll show you their pamphlets.  </span><span id="en17159">Everything with them is 'the influence of environment,' and nothing else.  </span><span id="en17161">Their favourite phrase!  </span><span id="en17163">From which it follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant.  </span><span id="en17165">Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it's not supposed to exist!  </span><span id="en17167">They don't recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process!  </span><span id="en17169">That's why they instinctively dislike history, 'nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,' and they explain it all as stupidity!  </span><span id="en17170">That's why they so dislike the  </span><i><span id="en17171">living </span></i><span id="en17172"> process of life; they don't want a  </span><i><span id="en17173">living soul </span></i><span id="en17175">! The living soul demands life, the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde!  </span><span id="en17177">But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won't revolt!  </span><span id="en17179">And it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery!  </span><span id="en17181">The phalanstery is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery—it wants life, it hasn't completed its vital process, it's too soon for the graveyard!  </span><span id="en17183">You can't skip over nature by logic.  </span><span id="en17185">Logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are millions!  </span><span id="en17187">Cut away a million, and reduce it all to the question of comfort!  </span><span id="en17189">That's the easiest solution of the problem!  </span><span id="en17191">It's seductively clear and you musn't think about it.  </span><span id="en17193">That's the great thing, you mustn't think!  </span><span id="en17195">The whole secret of life in two pages of print!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17200">"Now he is off, beating the drum!  </span><span id="en17202">Catch hold of him, do!"  </span><span id="en17204">laughed Porfiry. " </span><span id="en17206">Can you imagine," he turned to Raskolnikov, "six people holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a preliminary!  </span><span id="en17208">No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a great deal in crime; I can assure you of that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17211">"Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child of ten; was it environment drove him to it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17214">"Well, strictly speaking, it did," Porfiry observed with noteworthy gravity; "a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17217">Razumihin was almost in a frenzy. " </span><span id="en17219">Oh, if you like," he roared. " </span><span id="en17221">I'll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the Church of Ivan the Great's being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal tendency!  </span><span id="en17223">I undertake to!  </span><span id="en17225">Will you bet on it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17228">"Done!  </span><span id="en17230">Let's hear, please, how he will prove it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17233">"He is always humbugging, confound him," cried Razumihin, jumping up and gesticulating. " </span><span id="en17235">What's the use of talking to you?  </span><span id="en17237">He does all that on purpose; you don't know him, Rodion!  </span><span id="en17239">He took their side yesterday, simply to make fools of them.  </span><span id="en17241">And the things he said yesterday!  </span><span id="en17243">And they were delighted!  </span><span id="en17245">He can keep it up for a fortnight together.  </span><span id="en17247">Last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two months.  </span><span id="en17249">Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding.  </span><span id="en17251">He ordered new clothes indeed.  </span><span id="en17253">We all began to congratulate him.  </span><span id="en17255">There was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17258">"Ah, you are wrong!  </span><span id="en17260">I got the clothes before.  </span><span id="en17262">It was the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17265">"Are you such a good dissembler?"  </span><span id="en17267">Raskolnikov asked carelessly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17270">"You wouldn't have supposed it, eh?  </span><span id="en17272">Wait a bit, I shall take you in, too.  </span><span id="en17274">Ha-ha-ha!  </span><span id="en17276">No, I'll tell you the truth.  </span><span id="en17278">All these questions about crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time.  </span><span id="en17280">'On Crime'...  </span><span id="en17281">or something of the sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the  </span><i><span id="en17282">Periodical Review </span></i><span id="en17283">." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17286">"My article?  </span><span id="en17287">In the  </span><i><span id="en17288">Periodical Review </span></i><span id="en17290">?" Raskolnikov asked in astonishment. " </span><span id="en17291">I certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the  </span><i><span id="en17292">Weekly Review </span></i><span id="en17293">." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17296">"But it came out in the  </span><i><span id="en17297">Periodical </span></i><span id="en17298">." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17300">"And the  </span><i><span id="en17301">Weekly Review </span></i><span id="en17302">  </span><span id="en17303">ceased to exist, so that's why it wasn't printed at the time." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17306">"That's true; but when it ceased to exist, the  </span><i><span id="en17307">Weekly Review </span></i><span id="en17308"> was amalgamated with the  </span><i><span id="en17309">Periodical </span></i><span id="en17311">, and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter.  </span><span id="en17313">Didn't you know?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17318">Raskolnikov had not known. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17321">"Why, you might get some money out of them for the article!  </span><span id="en17323">What a strange person you are!  </span><span id="en17325">You lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly.  </span><span id="en17327">It's a fact, I assure you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17330">"Bravo, Rodya!  </span><span id="en17332">I knew nothing about it either!"  </span><span id="en17334">cried Razumihin. " </span><span id="en17336">I'll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number.  </span><span id="en17338">Two months ago?  </span><span id="en17340">What was the date?  </span><span id="en17342">It doesn't matter though, I will find it.  </span><span id="en17344">Think of not telling us!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17347">"How did you find out that the article was mine?  </span><span id="en17349">It's only signed with an initial." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17352">"I only learnt it by chance, the other day.  </span><span id="en17354">Through the editor; I know him....  </span><span id="en17356">I was very much interested." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17359">"I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17362">"Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness.  </span><span id="en17364">Very, very original, but...  </span><span id="en17366">it was not that part of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly.  </span><span id="en17368">There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain persons who can...  </span><span id="en17370">that is, not precisely are able to, but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the law is not for them." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17373">Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17376">"What?  </span><span id="en17378">What do you mean?  </span><span id="en17380">A right to crime?  </span><span id="en17382">But not because of the influence of environment?"  </span><span id="en17384">Razumihin inquired with some alarm even. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17387">"No, not exactly because of it," answered Porfiry. " </span><span id="en17389">In his article all men are divided into 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary. </span><span id="en17391">' Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don't you see, they are ordinary.  </span><span id="en17393">But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary.  </span><span id="en17395">That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17398">"What do you mean?  </span><span id="en17400">That can't be right?"  </span><span id="en17402">Razumihin muttered in bewilderment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17405">Raskolnikov smiled again.  </span><span id="en17407">He saw the point at once, and knew where they wanted to drive him.  </span><span id="en17409">He decided to take up the challenge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17412">"That wasn't quite my contention," he began simply and modestly. " </span><span id="en17414">Yet I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like, perfectly so."  </span><span id="en17416">(It almost gave him pleasure to admit this. </span><span id="en17418">) "The only difference is that I don't contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it.  </span><span id="en17420">In fact, I doubt whether such an argument could be published.  </span><span id="en17422">I simply hinted that an 'extraordinary' man has the right...  </span><span id="en17424">that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep...  </span><span id="en17426">certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).  </span><span id="en17428">You say that my article isn't definite; I am ready to make it as clear as I can.  </span><span id="en17430">Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well.  </span><span id="en17432">I maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have been in duty bound...  </span><span id="en17433">to  </span><i><span id="en17434">eliminate </span></i><span id="en17435">  </span><span id="en17436">the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity.  </span><span id="en17438">But it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market.  </span><span id="en17440">Then, I remember, I maintain in my article that all...  </span><span id="en17442">well, legislators and leaders of men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed—often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law—were of use to their cause.  </span><span id="en17444">It's remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage.  </span><span id="en17446">In short, I maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving some new word, must from their very nature be criminals—more or less, of course.  </span><span id="en17448">Otherwise it's hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can't submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it.  </span><span id="en17450">You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that.  </span><span id="en17452">The same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before.  </span><span id="en17454">As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that it's somewhat arbitrary, but I don't insist upon exact numbers.  </span><span id="en17455">I only believe in my leading idea that men are  </span><i><span id="en17456">in general </span></i><span id="en17457"> divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to utter  </span><i><span id="en17458">a new word </span></i><span id="en17460">. There are, of course, innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked.  </span><span id="en17462">The first category, generally speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled.  </span><span id="en17464">To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that's their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them.  </span><span id="en17466">The second category all transgress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities.  </span><span id="en17468">The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better.  </span><span id="en17470">But if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading through blood—that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.  </span><span id="en17472">It's only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article (you remember it began with the legal question).  </span><span id="en17474">There's no need for such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation.  </span><span id="en17476">But the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or less).  </span><span id="en17478">The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future.  </span><span id="en17480">The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal.  </span><span id="en17482">Each class has an equal right to exist.  </span><span id="en17483">In fact, all have equal rights with me—and  </span><i><span id="en17484">vive la guerre éternelle </span></i><span id="en17486">—till the New Jerusalem, of course!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17493">"Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17496">"I do," Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17499">"And...  </span><span id="en17501">and do you believe in God?  </span><span id="en17503">Excuse my curiosity." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17506">"I do," repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17509">"And...  </span><span id="en17511">do you believe in Lazarus' rising from the dead?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17514">"I...  </span><span id="en17516">I do.  </span><span id="en17518">Why do you ask all this?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17521">"You believe it literally?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17524">"Literally." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17527">"You don't say so....  </span><span id="en17529">I asked from curiosity.  </span><span id="en17531">Excuse me.  </span><span id="en17533">But let us go back to the question; they are not always executed.  </span><span id="en17535">Some, on the contrary..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17538">"Triumph in their lifetime?  </span><span id="en17540">Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this life, and then..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17543">"They begin executing other people?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17546">"If it's necessary; indeed, for the most part they do.  </span><span id="en17548">Your remark is very witty." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17551">"Thank you.  </span><span id="en17553">But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones?  </span><span id="en17555">Are there signs at their birth?  </span><span id="en17557">I feel there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition.  </span><span id="en17559">Excuse the natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn't they adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn't they wear something, be branded in some way?  </span><span id="en17561">For you know if confusion arises and a member of one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to 'eliminate obstacles' as you so happily expressed it, then..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17564">"Oh, that very often happens!  </span><span id="en17566">That remark is wittier than the other." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17569">"Thank you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17572">"No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps unfortunately called them).  </span><span id="en17574">In spite of their predisposition to obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people, 'destroyers,' and to push themselves into the 'new movement,' and this quite sincerely.  </span><span id="en17575">Meanwhile the really  </span><i><span id="en17576">new </span></i><span id="en17577">  </span><span id="en17578">people are very often unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling tendencies.  </span><span id="en17580">But I don't think there is any considerable danger here, and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far.  </span><span id="en17582">Of course, they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even this isn't necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own hands....  </span><span id="en17584">They will impose various public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect; in fact you've nothing to be uneasy about....  </span><span id="en17586">It's a law of nature." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17590">"Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but there's another thing worries me.  </span><span id="en17592">Tell me, please, are there many people who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people?  </span><span id="en17594">I am ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it's alarming if there are a great many of them, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17597">"Oh, you needn't worry about that either," Raskolnikov went on in the same tone. " </span><span id="en17598">People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something  </span><i><span id="en17599">new </span></i><span id="en17601">, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact.  </span><span id="en17603">One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature.  </span><span id="en17605">That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am convinced that it exists, and one day may become known.  </span><span id="en17607">The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence.  </span><span id="en17609">One in ten thousand perhaps—I speak roughly, approximately—is born with some independence, and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand.  </span><span id="en17611">The man of genius is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions.  </span><span id="en17613">In fact I have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place.  </span><span id="en17615">But there certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of chance." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17619">"Why, are you both joking?"  </span><span id="en17621">Razumihin cried at last. " </span><span id="en17623">There you sit, making fun of one another.  </span><span id="en17625">Are you serious, Rodya?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17628">Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.  </span><span id="en17629">And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and  </span><i><span id="en17630">discourteous </span></i><span id="en17631">  </span><span id="en17632">sarcasm of Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17636">"Well, brother, if you are really serious...  </span><span id="en17637">You are right, of course, in saying that it's not new, that it's like what we've read and heard a thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed  </span><i><span id="en17638">in the name of conscience </span></i><span id="en17640">, and, excuse my saying so, with such fanaticism....  </span><span id="en17642">That, I take it, is the point of your article.  </span><span id="en17643">But that sanction of bloodshed  </span><i><span id="en17644">by conscience </span></i><span id="en17645">  </span><span id="en17646">is to my mind...  </span><span id="en17648">more terrible than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17653">"You are quite right, it is more terrible," Porfiry agreed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17656">"Yes, you must have exaggerated!  </span><span id="en17658">There is some mistake, I shall read it.  </span><span id="en17660">You can't think that!  </span><span id="en17662">I shall read it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17665">"All that is not in the article, there's only a hint of it," said Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17668">"Yes, yes."  </span><span id="en17670">Porfiry couldn't sit still. " </span><span id="en17672">Your attitude to crime is pretty clear to me now, but...  </span><span id="en17674">excuse me for my impertinence (I am really ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you've removed my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but...  </span><span id="en17676">there are various practical possibilities that make me uneasy!  </span><span id="en17678">What if some man or youth imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet—a future one of course—and suppose he begins to remove all obstacles....  </span><span id="en17680">He has some great enterprise before him and needs money for it...  </span><span id="en17682">and tries to get it...  </span><span id="en17684">do you see?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17687">Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner.  </span><span id="en17689">Raskolnikov did not even raise his eyes to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17692">"I must admit," he went on calmly, "that such cases certainly must arise.  </span><span id="en17694">The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare; young people especially." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17697">"Yes, you see.  </span><span id="en17699">Well then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17702">"What then?"  </span><span id="en17704">Raskolnikov smiled in reply; "that's not my fault.  </span><span id="en17706">So it is and so it always will be.  </span><span id="en17708">He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin) that I sanction bloodshed.  </span><span id="en17710">Society is too well protected by prisons, banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude.  </span><span id="en17712">There's no need to be uneasy.  </span><span id="en17714">You have but to catch the thief." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17717">"And what if we do catch him?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17720">"Then he gets what he deserves." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17723">"You are certainly logical.  </span><span id="en17725">But what of his conscience?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17728">"Why do you care about that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17731">"Simply from humanity." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17734">"If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake.  </span><span id="en17736">That will be his punishment—as well as the prison." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17739">"But the real geniuses," asked Razumihin frowning, "those who have the right to murder?  </span><span id="en17741">Oughtn't they to suffer at all even for the blood they've shed?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17743">"Why the word  </span><i><span id="en17744">ought </span></i><span id="en17746">? It's not a matter of permission or prohibition.  </span><span id="en17748">He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim.  </span><span id="en17750">Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.  </span><span id="en17752">The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth," he added dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17756">He raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his cap.  </span><span id="en17758">He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and he felt this.  </span><span id="en17760">Everyone got up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17763">"Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like," Porfiry Petrovitch began again, "but I can't resist.  </span><span id="en17765">Allow me one little question (I know I am troubling you).  </span><span id="en17767">There is just one little notion I want to express, simply that I may not forget it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17770">"Very good, tell me your little notion," Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale and grave before him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17773">"Well, you see...  </span><span id="en17775">I really don't know how to express it properly....  </span><span id="en17777">It's a playful, psychological idea....  </span><span id="en17779">When you were writing your article, surely you couldn't have helped, he-he!  </span><span id="en17781">fancying yourself...  </span><span id="en17782">just a little, an 'extraordinary' man, uttering a  </span><i><span id="en17783">new word </span></i><span id="en17784">  </span><span id="en17785">in your sense....  </span><span id="en17787">That's so, isn't it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17791">"Quite possibly," Raskolnikov answered contemptuously. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17794">Razumihin made a movement. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17797">"And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity—to overstep obstacles?...  </span><span id="en17799">For instance, to rob and murder?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17802">And again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as before. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17805">"If I did I certainly should not tell you," Raskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty contempt. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17808">"No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary point of view..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17811">"Foo!  </span><span id="en17813">how obvious and insolent that is!"  </span><span id="en17815">Raskolnikov thought with repulsion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17818">"Allow me to observe," he answered dryly, "that I don't consider myself a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being one of them I cannot tell you how I should act." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17821">"Oh, come, don't we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?"  </span><span id="en17823">Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17826">Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17829">"Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona Ivanovna last week?"  </span><span id="en17831">Zametov blurted out from the corner. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17834">Raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.  </span><span id="en17836">Razumihin was scowling gloomily.  </span><span id="en17838">He seemed before this to be noticing something.  </span><span id="en17840">He looked angrily around.  </span><span id="en17842">There was a minute of gloomy silence.  </span><span id="en17844">Raskolnikov turned to go. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17847">"Are you going already?"  </span><span id="en17849">Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with excessive politeness. " </span><span id="en17851">Very, very glad of your acquaintance.  </span><span id="en17853">As for your request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still, come to me there yourself in a day or two...  </span><span id="en17855">to-morrow, indeed.  </span><span id="en17857">I shall be there at eleven o'clock for certain.  </span><span id="en17859">We'll arrange it all; we'll have a talk.  </span><span id="en17860">As one of the last to be  </span><i><span id="en17861">there </span></i><span id="en17863">, you might perhaps be able to tell us something," he added with a most good-natured expression. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17867">"You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?"  </span><span id="en17869">Raskolnikov asked sharply. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17872">"Oh, why?  </span><span id="en17874">That's not necessary for the present.  </span><span id="en17876">You misunderstand me.  </span><span id="en17878">I lose no opportunity, you see, and...  </span><span id="en17880">I've talked with all who had pledges....  </span><span id="en17882">I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the last....  </span><span id="en17884">Yes, by the way," he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, "I just remember, what was I thinking of?"  </span><span id="en17886">he turned to Razumihin, "you were talking my ears off about that Nikolay...  </span><span id="en17888">of course, I know, I know very well," he turned to Raskolnikov, "that the fellow is innocent, but what is one to do?  </span><span id="en17890">We had to trouble Dmitri too....  </span><span id="en17892">This is the point, this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn't it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17895">"Yes," answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17898">"Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn't you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember?  </span><span id="en17900">two workmen or at least one of them?  </span><span id="en17902">They were painting there, didn't you notice them?  </span><span id="en17904">It's very, very important for them." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17907">"Painters?  </span><span id="en17909">No, I didn't see them," Raskolnikov answered slowly, as though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. " </span><span id="en17911">No, I didn't see them, and I don't think I noticed a flat like that open....  </span><span id="en17913">But on the fourth storey" (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant) "I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna's....  </span><span id="en17915">I remember...  </span><span id="en17917">I remember it clearly.  </span><span id="en17919">Some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall.  </span><span id="en17921">But painters...  </span><span id="en17923">no, I don't remember that there were any painters, and I don't think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn't." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17926">"What do you mean?"  </span><span id="en17928">Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had reflected and realised. " </span><span id="en17930">Why, it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work, and he was there three days before?  </span><span id="en17932">What are you asking?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17935">"Foo!  </span><span id="en17937">I have muddled it!"  </span><span id="en17939">Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead. " </span><span id="en17941">Deuce take it!  </span><span id="en17943">This business is turning my brain!"  </span><span id="en17945">he addressed Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. " </span><span id="en17947">It would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at the flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something....  </span><span id="en17949">I quite muddled it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17952">"Then you should be more careful," Razumihin observed grimly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17955">The last words were uttered in the passage.  </span><span id="en17957">Porfiry Petrovitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17960">They went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they did not say a word.  </span><span id="en17962">Raskolnikov drew a deep breath. </span></p>

<p><span id="en17966">"I don't believe it, I can't believe it!"  </span><span id="en17968">repeated Razumihin, trying in perplexity to refute Raskolnikov's arguments. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17971">They were by now approaching Bakaleyev's lodgings, where Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while.  </span><span id="en17972">Razumihin kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about  </span><i><span id="en17973">it </span></i><span id="en17974">. </span></p>
<p><span id="en17977">"Don't believe it, then!"  </span><span id="en17979">answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless smile. " </span><span id="en17981">You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every word." </span></p>
<p><span id="en17984">"You are suspicious.  </span><span id="en17986">That is why you weighed their words...  </span><span id="en17988">h'm...  </span><span id="en17990">certainly, I agree, Porfiry's tone was rather strange, and still more that wretch Zametov!...  </span><span id="en17992">You are right, there was something about him—but why?  </span><span id="en17994">Why?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en17997">"He has changed his mind since last night." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18000">"Quite the contrary!  </span><span id="en18002">If they had that brainless idea, they would do their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you afterwards....  </span><span id="en18004">But it was all impudent and careless." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18007">"If they had had facts—I mean, real facts—or at least grounds for suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game, in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago besides).  </span><span id="en18009">But they have no facts, not one.  </span><span id="en18011">It is all mirage—all ambiguous.  </span><span id="en18013">Simply a floating idea.  </span><span id="en18015">So they try to throw me out by impudence.  </span><span id="en18017">And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted it out in his vexation—or perhaps he has some plan...  </span><span id="en18019">he seems an intelligent man.  </span><span id="en18021">Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to know.  </span><span id="en18023">They have a psychology of their own, brother.  </span><span id="en18025">But it is loathsome explaining it all.  </span><span id="en18027">Stop!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18030">"And it's insulting, insulting!  </span><span id="en18032">I understand you.  </span><span id="en18034">But...  </span><span id="en18036">since we have spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last—I am glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago, this idea.  </span><span id="en18038">Of course the merest hint only—an insinuation—but why an insinuation even?  </span><span id="en18040">How dare they?  </span><span id="en18042">What foundation have they?  </span><span id="en18044">If only you knew how furious I have been.  </span><span id="en18046">Think only!  </span><span id="en18048">Simply because a poor student, unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious illness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I. </span><span id="en18050">O. </span><span id="en18052">U.  </span><span id="en18054">presented by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach—he might well have a fainting fit!  </span><span id="en18056">And that, that is what they found it all on!  </span><span id="en18058">Damn them!  </span><span id="en18060">I understand how annoying it is, but in your place, Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces, and spit a dozen times in all directions.  </span><span id="en18062">I'd hit out in all directions, neatly too, and so I'd put an end to it.  </span><span id="en18064">Damn them!  </span><span id="en18066">Don't be downhearted.  </span><span id="en18068">It's a shame!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18071">"He really has put it well, though," Raskolnikov thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18074">"Damn them?  </span><span id="en18076">But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?"  </span><span id="en18078">he said with bitterness. " </span><span id="en18080">Must I really enter into explanations with them?  </span><span id="en18082">I feel vexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the restaurant...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18085">"Damn it!  </span><span id="en18087">I will go myself to Porfiry.  </span><span id="en18089">I will squeeze it out of him, as one of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all!  </span><span id="en18091">And as for Zametov..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18094">"At last he sees through him!"  </span><span id="en18096">thought Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18099">"Stay!"  </span><span id="en18101">cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. " </span><span id="en18103">Stay!  </span><span id="en18105">you were wrong.  </span><span id="en18107">I have thought it out.  </span><span id="en18109">You are wrong!  </span><span id="en18111">How was that a trap?  </span><span id="en18113">You say that the question about the workmen was a trap.  </span><span id="en18114">But if you had done  </span><i><span id="en18115">that </span></i><span id="en18117">, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...  </span><span id="en18119">and the workmen?  </span><span id="en18121">On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if you had seen it.  </span><span id="en18123">Who would own it against himself?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18126">"If I had done  </span><i><span id="en18127">that thing </span></i><span id="en18129">, I should certainly have said that I had seen the workmen and the flat," Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance and obvious disgust. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18133">"But why speak against yourself?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18136">"Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny everything flatly at examinations.  </span><span id="en18138">If a man is ever so little developed and experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts that can't be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another significance and put them in another light.  </span><span id="en18140">Porfiry might well reckon that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an air of truth, and then make some explanation." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18143">"But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been there two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on the day of the murder at eight o'clock.  </span><span id="en18145">And so he would have caught you over a detail." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18148">"Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days before." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18151">"But how could you forget it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18154">"Nothing easier.  </span><span id="en18156">It is in just such stupid things clever people are most easily caught.  </span><span id="en18158">The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing.  </span><span id="en18160">The more cunning a man is, the simpler the trap he must be caught in.  </span><span id="en18162">Porfiry is not such a fool as you think...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18165">"He is a knave then, if that is so!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18168">Raskolnikov could not help laughing.  </span><span id="en18170">But at the very moment, he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive, from necessity. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18173">"I am getting a relish for certain aspects!"  </span><span id="en18175">he thought to himself.  </span><span id="en18177">But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him.  </span><span id="en18179">His uneasiness kept on increasing.  </span><span id="en18181">They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev's. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18184">"Go in alone!"  </span><span id="en18186">said Raskolnikov suddenly. " </span><span id="en18188">I will be back directly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18191">"Where are you going?  </span><span id="en18193">Why, we are just here." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18196">"I can't help it....  </span><span id="en18198">I will come in half an hour.  </span><span id="en18200">Tell them." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18203">"Say what you like, I will come with you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18206">"You, too, want to torture me!"  </span><span id="en18208">he screamed, with such bitter irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin's hands dropped.  </span><span id="en18210">He stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging.  </span><span id="en18212">At last, gritting his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18215">When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was breathing heavily.  </span><span id="en18217">He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened the latch.  </span><span id="en18219">Then in senseless terror he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the hole, in every crack and fold of the paper.  </span><span id="en18221">Finding nothing, he got up and drew a deep breath.  </span><span id="en18223">As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev's, he suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been wrapped with the old woman's handwriting on it, might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18226">He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half senseless smile strayed on his lips.  </span><span id="en18228">He took his cap at last and went quietly out of the room.  </span><span id="en18230">His ideas were all tangled.  </span><span id="en18232">He went dreamily through the gateway. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18235">"Here he is himself," shouted a loud voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18238">He raised his head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18241">The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman.  </span><span id="en18243">He stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward.  </span><span id="en18245">From his wrinkled flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18248">"What is it?"  </span><span id="en18250">Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18253">The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the gate into the street without saying a word. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18256">"What is it?"  </span><span id="en18258">cried Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18261">"Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your name and whom you lodged with.  </span><span id="en18263">I saw you coming and pointed you out and he went away.  </span><span id="en18265">It's funny." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18268">The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18271">Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of him walking along the other side of the street with the same even, deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in meditation.  </span><span id="en18273">He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.  </span><span id="en18275">At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face.  </span><span id="en18277">The man noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again; and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18280">"You were inquiring for me...  </span><span id="en18282">of the porter?"  </span><span id="en18284">Raskolnikov said at last, but in a curiously quiet voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18287">The man made no answer; he didn't even look at him.  </span><span id="en18289">Again they were both silent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18292">"Why do you...  </span><span id="en18294">come and ask for me...  </span><span id="en18296">and say nothing....  </span><span id="en18298">What's the meaning of it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18301">Raskolnikov's voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words clearly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18304">The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18307">"Murderer!"  </span><span id="en18309">he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18312">Raskolnikov went on walking beside him.  </span><span id="en18314">His legs felt suddenly weak, a cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free.  </span><span id="en18316">So they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18319">The man did not look at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18322">"What do you mean...  </span><span id="en18324">what is....  </span><span id="en18326">Who is a murderer?"  </span><span id="en18328">muttered Raskolnikov hardly audibly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18330">" </span><i><span id="en18331">You </span></i><span id="en18332">  </span><span id="en18333">are a murderer," the man answered still more articulately and emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked straight into Raskolnikov's pale face and stricken eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18337">They had just reached the cross-roads.  </span><span id="en18339">The man turned to the left without looking behind him.  </span><span id="en18341">Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after him.  </span><span id="en18343">He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still standing there.  </span><span id="en18345">Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18348">With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over.  </span><span id="en18350">He took off his cap and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.  </span><span id="en18352">Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he stretched himself on it.  </span><span id="en18354">So he lay for half an hour. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18357">He thought of nothing.  </span><span id="en18359">Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some images without order or coherence floated before his mind—faces of people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V. </span><span id="en18361">, the billiard table in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the Sunday bells floating in from somewhere....  </span><span id="en18363">The images followed one another, whirling like a hurricane.  </span><span id="en18365">Some of them he liked and tried to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even pleasant....  </span><span id="en18367">The slight shivering still persisted, but that too was an almost pleasant sensation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18370">He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.  </span><span id="en18372">Razumihin opened the door and stood for some time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into the room and went cautiously to the sofa.  </span><span id="en18373">Raskolnikov heard Nastasya's whisper: </span></p>
<p><span id="en18375">"Don't disturb him!  </span><span id="en18377">Let him sleep.  </span><span id="en18379">He can have his dinner later." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18382">"Quite so," answered Razumihin.  </span><span id="en18384">Both withdrew carefully and closed the door.  </span><span id="en18386">Another half-hour passed.  </span><span id="en18388">Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on his back again, clasping his hands behind his head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18391">"Who is he?  </span><span id="en18393">Who is that man who sprang out of the earth?  </span><span id="en18395">Where was he, what did he see?  </span><span id="en18397">He has seen it all, that's clear.  </span><span id="en18399">Where was he then?  </span><span id="en18401">And from where did he see?  </span><span id="en18403">Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?  </span><span id="en18405">And how could he see?  </span><span id="en18407">Is it possible?  </span><span id="en18409">Hm..."  </span><span id="en18411">continued Raskolnikov, turning cold and shivering, "and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the door—was that possible?  </span><span id="en18413">A clue?  </span><span id="en18415">You miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence!  </span><span id="en18417">A fly flew by and saw it!  </span><span id="en18419">Is it possible?"  </span><span id="en18421">He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he had become. " </span><span id="en18423">I ought to have known it," he thought with a bitter smile. " </span><span id="en18425">And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an axe and shed blood!  </span><span id="en18427">I ought to have known beforehand....  </span><span id="en18429">Ah, but I did know!"  </span><span id="en18431">he whispered in despair.  </span><span id="en18433">At times he came to a standstill at some thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18436">"No, those men are not made so.  </span><span id="en18437">The real  </span><i><span id="en18438">Master </span></i><span id="en18439"> to whom all is permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris,  </span><i><span id="en18440">forgets </span></i><span id="en18441"> an army in Egypt,  </span><i><span id="en18442">wastes </span></i><span id="en18443">  </span><span id="en18444">half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vilna.  </span><span id="en18445">And altars are set up to him after his death, and so  </span><i><span id="en18446">all </span></i><span id="en18447">  </span><span id="en18448">is permitted.  </span><span id="en18450">No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but of bronze!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18457">One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh.  </span><span id="en18459">Napoleon, the pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed—it's a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to digest!  </span><span id="en18461">How can they digest it!  </span><span id="en18463">It's too inartistic. " </span><span id="en18465">A Napoleon creep under an old woman's bed!  </span><span id="en18467">Ugh, how loathsome!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18470">At moments he felt he was raving.  </span><span id="en18472">He sank into a state of feverish excitement. " </span><span id="en18474">The old woman is of no consequence," he thought, hotly and incoherently. " </span><span id="en18476">The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not what matters!  </span><span id="en18478">The old woman was only an illness....  </span><span id="en18480">I was in a hurry to overstep....  </span><span id="en18482">I didn't kill a human being, but a principle!  </span><span id="en18484">I killed the principle, but I didn't overstep, I stopped on this side....  </span><span id="en18486">I was only capable of killing.  </span><span id="en18488">And it seems I wasn't even capable of that...  </span><span id="en18490">Principle?  </span><span id="en18492">Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists?  </span><span id="en18494">They are industrious, commercial people; 'the happiness of all' is their case.  </span><span id="en18496">No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I don't want to wait for 'the happiness of all. </span><span id="en18498">' I want to live myself, or else better not live at all.  </span><span id="en18500">I simply couldn't pass by my mother starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the 'happiness of all. </span><span id="en18502">' I am putting my little brick into the happiness of all and so my heart is at peace.  </span><span id="en18504">Ha-ha!  </span><span id="en18506">Why have you let me slip?  </span><span id="en18508">I only live once, I too want....  </span><span id="en18510">Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing more," he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. " </span><span id="en18512">Yes, I am certainly a louse," he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure. " </span><span id="en18514">In the first place, because I can reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble object—ha-ha!  </span><span id="en18516">Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible, weighing, measuring and calculating.  </span><span id="en18518">Of all the lice I picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha! </span><span id="en18520">).  </span><span id="en18521">And what shows that I am utterly a louse," he added, grinding his teeth, "is that I am perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and  </span><i><span id="en18522">I felt beforehand </span></i><span id="en18523"> that I should tell myself so  </span><i><span id="en18524">after </span></i><span id="en18525">  </span><span id="en18526">killing her.  </span><span id="en18528">Can anything be compared with the horror of that?  </span><span id="en18530">The vulgarity!  </span><span id="en18532">The abjectness!  </span><span id="en18534">I understand the 'prophet' with his sabre, on his steed: Allah commands and 'trembling' creation must obey!  </span><span id="en18536">The 'prophet' is right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain!  </span><span id="en18537">It's for you to obey, trembling creation, and not  </span><i><span id="en18538">to have desires </span></i><span id="en18540">, for that's not for you!...  </span><span id="en18542">I shall never, never forgive the old woman!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18548">His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his eyes were fixed on the ceiling. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18551">"Mother, sister—how I loved them!  </span><span id="en18553">Why do I hate them now?  </span><span id="en18555">Yes, I hate them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can't bear them near me....  </span><span id="en18557">I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember....  </span><span id="en18559">To embrace her and think if she only knew...  </span><span id="en18561">shall I tell her then?  </span><span id="en18563">That's just what I might do....  </span><i><span id="en18565">She </span></i><span id="en18566">  </span><span id="en18567">must be the same as I am," he added, straining himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. " </span><span id="en18569">Ah, how I hate the old woman now!  </span><span id="en18571">I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!  </span><span id="en18573">Poor Lizaveta!  </span><span id="en18575">Why did she come in?...  </span><span id="en18577">It's strange though, why is it I scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn't killed her?  </span><span id="en18579">Lizaveta!  </span><span id="en18581">Sonia!  </span><span id="en18583">Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes....  </span><span id="en18585">Dear women!  </span><span id="en18587">Why don't they weep?  </span><span id="en18589">Why don't they moan?  </span><span id="en18591">They give up everything...  </span><span id="en18593">their eyes are soft and gentle....  </span><span id="en18595">Sonia, Sonia!  </span><span id="en18597">Gentle Sonia!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18601">He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn't remember how he got into the street.  </span><span id="en18603">It was late evening.  </span><span id="en18605">The twilight had fallen and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a peculiar breathlessness in the air.  </span><span id="en18607">There were crowds of people in the street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and stagnant water.  </span><span id="en18609">Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten.  </span><span id="en18611">Suddenly he stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street, beckoning to him.  </span><span id="en18613">He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to him. " </span><span id="en18615">Stay, did he really beckon?"  </span><span id="en18617">Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried to overtake him.  </span><span id="en18619">When he was within ten paces he recognised him and was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long coat.  </span><span id="en18621">Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating; they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. " </span><span id="en18623">Does he know I am following him?"  </span><span id="en18625">thought Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en18627">The man went into the gateway of a big house.  </span><span id="en18629">Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign to him.  </span><span id="en18631">In the court-yard the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him.  </span><span id="en18633">Raskolnikov at once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone.  </span><span id="en18635">He must have gone up the first staircase.  </span><span id="en18637">Raskolnikov rushed after him.  </span><span id="en18639">He heard slow measured steps two flights above.  </span><span id="en18641">The staircase seemed strangely familiar.  </span><span id="en18643">He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he reached the second floor.  </span><span id="en18645">Bah!  </span><span id="en18647">this is the flat where the painters were at work...  </span><span id="en18649">but how was it he did not recognise it at once?  </span><span id="en18651">The steps of the man above had died away. " </span><span id="en18653">So he must have stopped or hidden somewhere."  </span><span id="en18655">He reached the third storey, should he go on?  </span><span id="en18657">There was a stillness that was dreadful....  </span><span id="en18659">But he went on.  </span><span id="en18661">The sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened him.  </span><span id="en18663">How dark it was!  </span><span id="en18665">The man must be hiding in some corner here.  </span><span id="en18667">Ah!  </span><span id="en18669">the flat was standing wide open, he hesitated and went in.  </span><span id="en18671">It was very dark and empty in the passage, as though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight.  </span><span id="en18673">Everything there was as before, the chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames.  </span><span id="en18675">A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows. " </span><span id="en18677">It's the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery," thought Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en18679">He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was painful.  </span><span id="en18681">And still the same hush.  </span><span id="en18683">Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again.  </span><span id="en18685">A fly flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz.  </span><span id="en18687">At that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. " </span><span id="en18689">Why is that cloak here?"  </span><span id="en18691">he thought, "it wasn't there before...."  </span><span id="en18693">He went up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding behind it.  </span><span id="en18695">He cautiously moved the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent double so that he couldn't see her face; but it was she.  </span><span id="en18697">He stood over her. " </span><span id="en18699">She is afraid," he thought.  </span><span id="en18701">He stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull.  </span><span id="en18703">But strange to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood.  </span><span id="en18705">He was frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too, bent her head lower.  </span><span id="en18707">He bent right down to the ground and peeped up into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing her utmost that he should not hear it.  </span><span id="en18709">Suddenly he fancied that the door from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and whispering within.  </span><span id="en18711">He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth.  </span><span id="en18713">He was rushing away, but the passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.  </span><span id="en18715">Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they would not move....  </span><span id="en18717">He tried to scream and woke up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18720">He drew a deep breath—but his dream seemed strangely to persist: his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the doorway watching him intently. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18723">Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them again.  </span><span id="en18725">He lay on his back without stirring. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18728">"Is it still a dream?"  </span><span id="en18730">he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18733">He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane and his chin on his hands.  </span><span id="en18735">It was evident that he was prepared to wait indefinitely.  </span><span id="en18737">As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost whitish beard. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18740">Ten minutes passed.  </span><span id="en18742">It was still light, but beginning to get dusk.  </span><span id="en18744">There was complete stillness in the room.  </span><span id="en18746">Not a sound came from the stairs.  </span><span id="en18748">Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane.  </span><span id="en18750">It was unbearable at last.  </span><span id="en18752">Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18755">"Come, tell me what you want." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18758">"I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending," the stranger answered oddly, laughing calmly. " </span><span id="en18760">Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to introduce myself...." </span></p>

<p><span id="en18765">"Can this be still a dream?"  </span><span id="en18767">Raskolnikov thought once more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18770">He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18773">"Svidrigaïlov!  </span><span id="en18775">What nonsense!  </span><span id="en18777">It can't be!"  </span><span id="en18779">he said at last aloud in bewilderment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18782">His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18785">"I've come to you for two reasons.  </span><span id="en18787">In the first place, I wanted to make your personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en18789">For without your support she might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me, but with your assistance I reckon on..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18792">"You reckon wrongly," interrupted Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18795">"They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18798">Raskolnikov made no reply. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18801">"It was yesterday, I know.  </span><span id="en18803">I only arrived myself the day before.  </span><span id="en18805">Well, let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don't consider it necessary to justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly criminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice, with common sense?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18808">Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18811">"That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and 'insulted her with my infamous proposals'—is that it?  </span><span id="en18813">(I am anticipating you. </span><span id="en18814">) But you've only to assume that I, too, am a man  </span><i><span id="en18815">et nihil humanum </span></i><span id="en18817">...  </span><span id="en18819">in a word, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which does not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the most natural manner.  </span><span id="en18821">The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself a victim?  </span><span id="en18823">And what if I am a victim?  </span><span id="en18825">In proposing to the object of my passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished the deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting our mutual happiness!  </span><span id="en18827">Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why, probably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18831">"But that's not the point," Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. " </span><span id="en18833">It's simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you.  </span><span id="en18835">We don't want to have anything to do with you.  </span><span id="en18837">We show you the door.  </span><span id="en18839">Go out!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18842">Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18845">"But you're...  </span><span id="en18847">but there's no getting round you," he said, laughing in the frankest way. " </span><span id="en18849">I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right line at once!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18852">"But you are trying to get round me still!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18855">"What of it?  </span><span id="en18857">What of it?"  </span><span id="en18859">cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly. " </span><span id="en18860">But this is what the French call  </span><i><span id="en18861">bonne guerre </span></i><span id="en18863">, and the most innocent form of deception!...  </span><span id="en18865">But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for what happened in the garden.  </span><span id="en18867">Marfa Petrovna..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18871">"You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?"  </span><span id="en18873">Raskolnikov interrupted rudely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18876">"Oh, you've heard that, too, then?  </span><span id="en18878">You'd be sure to, though....  </span><span id="en18880">But as for your question, I really don't know what to say, though my own conscience is quite at rest on that score.  </span><span id="en18882">Don't suppose that I am in any apprehension about it.  </span><span id="en18884">All was regular and in order; the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing else.  </span><span id="en18886">But I'll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on my way here in the train, especially: didn't I contribute to all that...  </span><span id="en18888">calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the sort.  </span><span id="en18890">But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the question." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18893">Raskolnikov laughed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18896">"I wonder you trouble yourself about it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18899">"But what are you laughing at?  </span><span id="en18901">Only consider, I struck her just twice with a switch—there were no marks even...  </span><span id="en18903">don't regard me as a cynic, please; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that; but I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased at my, so to say, warmth.  </span><span id="en18905">The story of your sister had been wrung out to the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town.  </span><span id="en18907">Besides, she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the letter).  </span><span id="en18909">And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven!  </span><span id="en18911">Her first act was to order the carriage to be got out....  </span><span id="en18913">Not to speak of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be insulted in spite of all their show of indignation.  </span><span id="en18915">There are instances of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to be insulted, have you noticed that?  </span><span id="en18917">But it's particularly so with women.  </span><span id="en18919">One might even say it's their only amusement." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18922">At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so finishing the interview.  </span><span id="en18924">But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18927">"You are fond of fighting?"  </span><span id="en18929">he asked carelessly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18932">"No, not very," Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. " </span><span id="en18934">And Marfa Petrovna and I scarcely ever fought.  </span><span id="en18936">We lived very harmoniously, and she was always pleased with me.  </span><span id="en18938">I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character).  </span><span id="en18940">The first time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking.  </span><span id="en18942">Did you suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?  </span><span id="en18944">Ha, ha!  </span><span id="en18946">By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I've forgotten his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having thrashed a German woman in the railway train.  </span><span id="en18948">You remember?  </span><span id="en18949">It was in those days, that very year I believe, the 'disgraceful action of the  </span><i><span id="en18950">Age </span></i><span id="en18952">' took place (you know, 'The Egyptian Nights,' that public reading, you remember?  </span><span id="en18954">The dark eyes, you know!  </span><span id="en18956">Ah, the golden days of our youth, where are they? </span><span id="en18958">).  </span><span id="en18960">Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German, I feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there for sympathy?  </span><span id="en18962">But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking 'Germans' that I don't believe there is a progressive who could quite answer for himself.  </span><span id="en18964">No one looked at the subject from that point of view then, but that's the truly humane point of view, I assure you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18968">After saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.  </span><span id="en18970">Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18973">"I expect you've not talked to anyone for some days?"  </span><span id="en18975">he asked. </span></p>
<p><span id="en18978">"Scarcely anyone.  </span><span id="en18980">I suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable man?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en18983">"No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man." </span></p>
<p><span id="en18986">"Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions?  </span><span id="en18988">Is that it?  </span><span id="en18990">But why take offence?  </span><span id="en18992">As you asked, so I answered," he replied, with a surprising expression of simplicity. " </span><span id="en18994">You know, there's hardly anything I take interest in," he went on, as it were dreamily, "especially now, I've nothing to do....  </span><span id="en18996">You are quite at liberty to imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as I told you I want to see your sister about something.  </span><span id="en18998">But I'll confess frankly, I am very much bored.  </span><span id="en19000">The last three days especially, so I am delighted to see you....  </span><span id="en19002">Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself.  </span><span id="en19004">Say what you like, there's something wrong with you, and now, too...  </span><span id="en19006">not this very minute, I mean, but now, generally....  </span><span id="en19008">Well, well, I won't, I won't, don't scowl!  </span><span id="en19010">I am not such a bear, you know, as you think." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19013">Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19016">"You are not a bear, perhaps, at all," he said. " </span><span id="en19018">I fancy indeed that you are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to behave like one." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19021">"I am not particularly interested in anyone's opinion," Svidrigaïlov answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, "and therefore why not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate...  </span><span id="en19023">and especially if one has a natural propensity that way," he added, laughing again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19026">"But I've heard you have many friends here.  </span><span id="en19028">You are, as they say, 'not without connections. </span><span id="en19030">' What can you want with me, then, unless you've some special object?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19033">"That's true that I have friends here," Svidrigaïlov admitted, not replying to the chief point. " </span><span id="en19035">I've met some already.  </span><span id="en19037">I've been lounging about for the last three days, and I've seen them, or they've seen me.  </span><span id="en19039">That's a matter of course.  </span><span id="en19041">I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor man; the emancipation of the serfs hasn't affected me; my property consists chiefly of forests and water meadows.  </span><span id="en19043">The revenue has not fallen off; but...  </span><span id="en19045">I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long ago.  </span><span id="en19047">I've been here three days and have called on no one....  </span><span id="en19049">What a town it is!  </span><span id="en19051">How has it come into existence among us, tell me that?  </span><span id="en19053">A town of officials and students of all sorts.  </span><span id="en19055">Yes, there's a great deal I didn't notice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels....  </span><span id="en19057">My only hope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19060">"Anatomy?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19063">"But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed, maybe—well, all that can go on without me," he went on, again without noticing the question. " </span><span id="en19065">Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19068">"Why, have you been a card-sharper then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19071">"How could I help being?  </span><span id="en19073">There was a regular set of us, men of the best society, eight years ago; we had a fine time.  </span><span id="en19075">And all men of breeding, you know, poets, men of property.  </span><span id="en19077">And indeed as a rule in our Russian society the best manners are found among those who've been thrashed, have you noticed that?  </span><span id="en19079">I've deteriorated in the country.  </span><span id="en19081">But I did get into prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin.  </span><span id="en19083">Then Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand).  </span><span id="en19085">We were united in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.  </span><span id="en19087">You know she was five years older than I.  </span><span id="en19089">She was very fond of me.  </span><span id="en19091">For seven years I never left the country.  </span><span id="en19093">And, take note, that all my life she held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at once!  </span><span id="en19095">And she would have done it!  </span><span id="en19097">Women find nothing incompatible in that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19100">"If it hadn't been for that, would you have given her the slip?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19103">"I don't know what to say.  </span><span id="en19105">It was scarcely the document restrained me.  </span><span id="en19107">I didn't want to go anywhere else.  </span><span id="en19109">Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go abroad, seeing I was bored, but I've been abroad before, and always felt sick there.  </span><span id="en19111">For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the sea—you look at them and it makes you sad.  </span><span id="en19113">What's most revolting is that one is really sad!  </span><span id="en19115">No, it's better at home.  </span><span id="en19117">Here at least one blames others for everything and excuses oneself.  </span><span id="en19118">I should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because  </span><i><span id="en19119">j'ai le vin mauvais </span></i><span id="en19120">  </span><span id="en19121">and hate drinking, and there's nothing left but wine.  </span><span id="en19123">I have tried it.  </span><span id="en19125">But, I say, I've been told Berg is going up in a great balloon next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a fee.  </span><span id="en19127">Is it true?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19131">"Why, would you go up?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19134">"I...  </span><span id="en19136">No, oh, no," muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19139">"What does he mean?  </span><span id="en19141">Is he in earnest?"  </span><span id="en19143">Raskolnikov wondered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19146">"No, the document didn't restrain me," Svidrigaïlov went on, meditatively. " </span><span id="en19148">It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day and made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too.  </span><span id="en19150">She had a fortune, you know.  </span><span id="en19152">'You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch'—that was actually her expression.  </span><span id="en19154">You don't believe she used it?  </span><span id="en19156">But do you know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the neighbourhood.  </span><span id="en19158">I ordered books, too.  </span><span id="en19160">Marfa Petrovna at first approved, but afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19163">"You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19166">"Missing her?  </span><span id="en19168">Perhaps.  </span><span id="en19170">Really, perhaps I am.  </span><span id="en19172">And, by the way, do you believe in ghosts?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19175">"What ghosts?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19178">"Why, ordinary ghosts." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19181">"Do you believe in them?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19183">"Perhaps not,  </span><i><span id="en19184">pour vous plaire </span></i><span id="en19186">....  </span><span id="en19188">I wouldn't say no exactly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19192">"Do you see them, then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19195">Svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19198">"Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me," he said, twisting his mouth into a strange smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19201">"How do you mean 'she is pleased to visit you'?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19204">"She has been three times.  </span><span id="en19206">I saw her first on the very day of the funeral, an hour after she was buried.  </span><span id="en19208">It was the day before I left to come here.  </span><span id="en19210">The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two hours ago in the room where I am staying.  </span><span id="en19212">I was alone." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19215">"Were you awake?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19218">"Quite awake.  </span><span id="en19220">I was wide awake every time.  </span><span id="en19222">She comes, speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door—always at the door.  </span><span id="en19224">I can almost hear her." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19227">"What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to you?"  </span><span id="en19229">Raskolnikov said suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19232">At the same moment he was surprised at having said it.  </span><span id="en19234">He was much excited. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19237">"What!  </span><span id="en19239">Did you think so?"  </span><span id="en19241">Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment. " </span><span id="en19243">Did you really?  </span><span id="en19245">Didn't I say that there was something in common between us, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19248">"You never said so!"  </span><span id="en19250">Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19253">"Didn't I?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19256">"No!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19259">"I thought I did.  </span><span id="en19261">When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut, pretending, I said to myself at once, 'Here's the man. </span><span id="en19262">'" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19264">"What do you mean by 'the man? </span><span id="en19266">' What are you talking about?"  </span><span id="en19268">cried Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19271">"What do I mean?  </span><span id="en19273">I really don't know...."  </span><span id="en19275">Svidrigaïlov muttered ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19278">For a minute they were silent.  </span><span id="en19280">They stared in each other's faces. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19283">"That's all nonsense!"  </span><span id="en19285">Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. " </span><span id="en19287">What does she say when she comes to you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19290">"She!  </span><span id="en19292">Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and—man is a strange creature—it makes me angry.  </span><span id="en19294">The first time she came in (I was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch afterwards.  </span><span id="en19296">At last I was left alone in my study.  </span><span id="en19298">I lighted a cigar and began to think), she came in at the door.  </span><span id="en19300">'You've been so busy to-day, Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,' she said.  </span><span id="en19302">All those seven years I've wound that clock every week, and if I forgot it she would always remind me.  </span><span id="en19304">The next day I set off on my way here.  </span><span id="en19306">I got out at the station at daybreak; I'd been asleep, tired out, with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee.  </span><span id="en19308">I looked up and there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of cards in her hands.  </span><span id="en19310">'Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady Ivanovitch? </span><span id="en19312">' She was a great hand at telling fortunes.  </span><span id="en19314">I shall never forgive myself for not asking her to.  </span><span id="en19316">I ran away in a fright, and, besides, the bell rang.  </span><span id="en19318">I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden Marfa Petrovna again.  </span><span id="en19320">She came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train.  </span><span id="en19322">'Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch!  </span><span id="en19324">How do you like my dress?  </span><span id="en19326">Aniska can't make like this. </span><span id="en19328">' (Aniska was a dressmaker in the country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a pretty wench. </span><span id="en19330">) She stood turning round before me.  </span><span id="en19332">I looked at the dress, and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face.  </span><span id="en19334">'I wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna. </span><span id="en19336">' 'Good gracious, you won't let one disturb you about anything! </span><span id="en19338">' To tease her I said, 'I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna. </span><span id="en19340">' 'That's just like you, Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you've hardly buried your wife.  </span><span id="en19342">And if you could make a good choice, at least, but I know it won't be for your happiness or hers, you will only be a laughing-stock to all good people. </span><span id="en19344">' Then she went out and her train seemed to rustle.  </span><span id="en19346">Isn't it nonsense, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19349">"But perhaps you are telling lies?"  </span><span id="en19351">Raskolnikov put in. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19354">"I rarely lie," answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not noticing the rudeness of the question. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19357">"And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19360">"Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago.  </span><span id="en19362">I had a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting 'Filka, my pipe! </span><span id="en19364">' He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were.  </span><span id="en19366">I sat still and thought 'he is doing it out of revenge,' because we had a violent quarrel just before his death.  </span><span id="en19368">'How dare you come in with a hole in your elbow? </span><span id="en19370">' I said.  </span><span id="en19372">'Go away, you scamp! </span><span id="en19374">' He turned and went out, and never came again.  </span><span id="en19376">I didn't tell Marfa Petrovna at the time.  </span><span id="en19378">I wanted to have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19381">"You should go to a doctor." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19384">"I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don't know what's wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are.  </span><span id="en19386">I didn't ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you believe that they exist." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19389">"No, I won't believe it!"  </span><span id="en19391">Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19394">"What do people generally say?"  </span><span id="en19396">muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. " </span><span id="en19398">They say, 'You are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy. </span><span id="en19400">' But that's not strictly logical.  </span><span id="en19402">I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that they don't exist." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19405">"Nothing of the sort," Raskolnikov insisted irritably. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19408">"No?  </span><span id="en19410">You don't think so?"  </span><span id="en19412">Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him deliberately. " </span><span id="en19414">But what do you say to this argument (help me with it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the beginning of them.  </span><span id="en19416">A man in health has, of course, no reason to see them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of completeness and order to live only in this life.  </span><span id="en19418">But as soon as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one's contact with that other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that world.  </span><span id="en19420">I thought of that long ago.  </span><span id="en19422">If you believe in a future life, you could believe in that, too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19425">"I don't believe in a future life," said Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19428">Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19431">"And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort," he said suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19434">"He is a madman," thought Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19437">"We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception, something vast, vast!  </span><span id="en19439">But why must it be vast?  </span><span id="en19441">Instead of all that, what if it's one little room, like a bath house in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is?  </span><span id="en19443">I sometimes fancy it like that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19446">"Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that?"  </span><span id="en19448">Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19451">"Juster?  </span><span id="en19453">And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know it's what I would certainly have made it," answered Svidrigaïlov, with a vague smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19456">This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en19458">Svidrigaïlov raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19461">"Only think," he cried, "half an hour ago we had never seen each other, we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between us; we've thrown it aside, and away we've gone into the abstract!  </span><span id="en19463">Wasn't I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19466">"Kindly allow me," Raskolnikov went on irritably, "to ask you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit...  </span><span id="en19468">and...  </span><span id="en19470">and I am in a hurry, I have no time to waste.  </span><span id="en19472">I want to go out." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19475">"By all means, by all means.  </span><span id="en19477">Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to be married to Mr.  </span><span id="en19479">Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19482">"Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her name?  </span><span id="en19484">I can't understand how you dare utter her name in my presence, if you really are Svidrigaïlov." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19487">"Why, but I've come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning her?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19490">"Very good, speak, but make haste." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19493">"I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.  </span><span id="en19495">Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him.  </span><span id="en19497">He is no match for Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en19499">I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing herself generously and imprudently for the sake of...  </span><span id="en19501">for the sake of her family.  </span><span id="en19503">I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly advantages.  </span><span id="en19505">Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19508">"All this is very naïve...  </span><span id="en19510">excuse me, I should have said impudent on your part," said Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19513">"You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends.  </span><span id="en19515">Don't be uneasy, Rodion Romanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have spoken out so directly.  </span><span id="en19517">I am not quite a fool.  </span><span id="en19519">I will confess something psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for Avdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim.  </span><span id="en19521">Well, let me tell you that I've no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder myself indeed, for I really did feel something..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19524">"Through idleness and depravity," Raskolnikov put in. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19527">"I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities that even I could not help being impressed by them.  </span><span id="en19529">But that's all nonsense, as I see myself now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19532">"Have you seen that long?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19535">"I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg.  </span><span id="en19537">I still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna's hand and to cut out Mr.  </span><span id="en19539">Luzhin." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19542">"Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object of your visit.  </span><span id="en19544">I am in a hurry, I want to go out..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19547">"With the greatest pleasure.  </span><span id="en19549">On arriving here and determining on a certain...  </span><span id="en19551">journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary arrangements.  </span><span id="en19553">I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided for; and they have no need of me personally.  </span><span id="en19555">And a nice father I should make, too!  </span><span id="en19557">I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year ago.  </span><span id="en19559">That's enough for me.  </span><span id="en19561">Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.  </span><span id="en19563">Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr.  </span><span id="en19565">Luzhin, too.  </span><span id="en19567">It's not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.  </span><span id="en19569">I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she will never gain anything but harm from Mr.  </span><span id="en19571">Luzhin.  </span><span id="en19573">Then, begging her pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr.  </span><span id="en19575">Luzhin, a rupture to which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way to it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19578">"You are certainly mad," cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as astonished. " </span><span id="en19580">How dare you talk like that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19583">"I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no need for it.  </span><span id="en19585">If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste it in some more foolish way.  </span><span id="en19587">That's the first thing.  </span><span id="en19589">Secondly, my conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.  </span><span id="en19591">You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will know.  </span><span id="en19593">The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely regretting it, I want—not to compensate, not to repay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm.  </span><span id="en19595">If there were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps, very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion of any design on Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en19597">In conclusion, let me say that in marrying Mr.  </span><span id="en19599">Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from another man.  </span><span id="en19601">Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly and quietly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19604">Svidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying this. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19607">"I beg you to say no more," said Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en19609">In any case this is unpardonable impertinence." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19612">"Not in the least.  </span><span id="en19614">Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour in this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities.  </span><span id="en19616">That's absurd.  </span><span id="en19618">If I died, for instance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she wouldn't refuse it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19621">"Very likely she would." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19624">"Oh, no, indeed.  </span><span id="en19626">However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion.  </span><span id="en19628">In any case I beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19631">"No, I won't." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19634">"In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her myself and worry her by doing so." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19637">"And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19640">"I don't know really what to say.  </span><span id="en19642">I should like very much to see her once more." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19645">"Don't hope for it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19648">"I'm sorry.  </span><span id="en19650">But you don't know me.  </span><span id="en19652">Perhaps we may become better friends." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19655">"You think we may become friends?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19658">"And why not?"  </span><span id="en19660">Svidrigaïlov said, smiling.  </span><span id="en19662">He stood up and took his hat. " </span><span id="en19664">I didn't quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning on it...  </span><span id="en19666">though I was very much struck by your face this morning." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19669">"Where did you see me this morning?"  </span><span id="en19671">Raskolnikov asked uneasily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19674">"I saw you by chance....  </span><span id="en19676">I kept fancying there is something about you like me....  </span><span id="en19678">But don't be uneasy.  </span><span id="en19679">I am not intrusive; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great personage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about Raphael's  </span><i><span id="en19680">Madonna </span></i><span id="en19681">  </span><span id="en19682">in Madam Prilukov's album, and I never left Marfa Petrovna's side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at Viazemsky's house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in a balloon with Berg, perhaps." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19686">"Oh, all right.  </span><span id="en19688">Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19691">"What travels?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19694">"Why, on that 'journey'; you spoke of it yourself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19697">"A journey?  </span><span id="en19699">Oh, yes.  </span><span id="en19701">I did speak of a journey.  </span><span id="en19703">Well, that's a wide subject....  </span><span id="en19705">if only you knew what you are asking," he added, and gave a sudden, loud, short laugh. " </span><span id="en19707">Perhaps I'll get married instead of the journey.  </span><span id="en19709">They're making a match for me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19712">"Here?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19715">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19718">"How have you had time for that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19721">"But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once.  </span><span id="en19723">I earnestly beg it.  </span><span id="en19725">Well, good-bye for the present.  </span><span id="en19727">Oh, yes.  </span><span id="en19729">I have forgotten something.  </span><span id="en19731">Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered her in her will and left her three thousand roubles.  </span><span id="en19733">That's absolutely certain.  </span><span id="en19735">Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was done in my presence.  </span><span id="en19737">Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money in two or three weeks." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19740">"Are you telling the truth?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19743">"Yes, tell her.  </span><span id="en19745">Well, your servant.  </span><span id="en19747">I am staying very near you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19750">As he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway. </span></p>

<p><span id="en19754">It was nearly eight o'clock.  </span><span id="en19756">The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev's, to arrive before Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19759">"Why, who was that?"  </span><span id="en19761">asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19764">"It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was their governess.  </span><span id="en19766">Through his persecuting her with his attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna.  </span><span id="en19768">This Marfa Petrovna begged Dounia's forgiveness afterwards, and she's just died suddenly.  </span><span id="en19770">It was of her we were talking this morning.  </span><span id="en19772">I don't know why I'm afraid of that man.  </span><span id="en19774">He came here at once after his wife's funeral.  </span><span id="en19776">He is very strange, and is determined on doing something....  </span><span id="en19778">We must guard Dounia from him...  </span><span id="en19780">that's what I wanted to tell you, do you hear?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19783">"Guard her!  </span><span id="en19785">What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna?  </span><span id="en19787">Thank you, Rodya, for speaking to me like that....  </span><span id="en19789">We will, we will guard her.  </span><span id="en19791">Where does he live?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19794">"I don't know." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19797">"Why didn't you ask?  </span><span id="en19799">What a pity!  </span><span id="en19801">I'll find out, though." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19804">"Did you see him?"  </span><span id="en19806">asked Raskolnikov after a pause. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19809">"Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19812">"You did really see him?  </span><span id="en19814">You saw him clearly?"  </span><span id="en19816">Raskolnikov insisted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19819">"Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have a good memory for faces." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19822">They were silent again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19825">"Hm!...  </span><span id="en19827">that's all right," muttered Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en19829">Do you know, I fancied...  </span><span id="en19831">I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19834">"What do you mean?  </span><span id="en19836">I don't understand you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19839">"Well, you all say," Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a smile, "that I am mad.  </span><span id="en19841">I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad, and have only seen a phantom." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19844">"What do you mean?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19847">"Why, who can tell?  </span><span id="en19849">Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that happened all these days may be only imagination." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19852">"Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!...  </span><span id="en19854">But what did he say, what did he come for?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19857">Raskolnikov did not answer.  </span><span id="en19859">Razumihin thought a minute. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19862">"Now let me tell you my story," he began, "I came to you, you were asleep.  </span><span id="en19864">Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry's, Zametov was still with him.  </span><span id="en19866">I tried to begin, but it was no use.  </span><span id="en19868">I couldn't speak in the right way.  </span><span id="en19870">They don't seem to understand and can't understand, but are not a bit ashamed.  </span><span id="en19872">I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking to him, but it was still no use.  </span><span id="en19874">He looked away and I looked away.  </span><span id="en19876">At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I'd brain him.  </span><span id="en19878">He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away.  </span><span id="en19880">That was all.  </span><span id="en19882">It was very stupid.  </span><span id="en19884">To Zametov I didn't say a word.  </span><span id="en19886">But, you see, I thought I'd made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why should we trouble?  </span><span id="en19888">Of course if you were in any danger or anything, but why need you care?  </span><span id="en19890">You needn't care a hang for them.  </span><span id="en19892">We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I'd mystify them more than ever.  </span><span id="en19894">How ashamed they'll be afterwards!  </span><span id="en19896">Hang them!  </span><span id="en19898">We can thrash them afterwards, but let's laugh at them now!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19901">"To be sure," answered Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en19903">But what will you say to-morrow?"  </span><span id="en19905">he thought to himself.  </span><span id="en19907">Strange to say, till that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew.  </span><span id="en19909">As he thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him.  </span><span id="en19911">Razumihin's account of his visit to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone since then. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19914">In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in together without greeting or looking at one another.  </span><span id="en19916">The young men walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in the passage, taking off his coat.  </span><span id="en19918">Pulcheria Alexandrovna came forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her brother.  </span><span id="en19920">Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies.  </span><span id="en19922">He looked, however, as though he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself.  </span><span id="en19924">Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling.  </span><span id="en19926">Dounia and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.  </span><span id="en19928">Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19931">A moment's silence followed.  </span><span id="en19933">Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an explanation.  </span><span id="en19935">In the passage the idea had occurred to him to keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.  </span><span id="en19937">But he could not bring himself to do this.  </span><span id="en19939">Besides, he could not endure uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19942">"I trust you had a favourable journey," he inquired officially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19945">"Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19948">"I am gratified to hear it.  </span><span id="en19950">And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued either?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19953">"I am young and strong, I don't get tired, but it was a great strain for mother," answered Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19956">"That's unavoidable!  </span><span id="en19958">our national railways are of terrible length.  </span><span id="en19960">'Mother Russia,' as they say, is a vast country....  </span><span id="en19962">In spite of all my desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday.  </span><span id="en19964">But I trust all passed off without inconvenience?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en19967">"Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, "and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself, we should have been utterly lost.  </span><span id="en19969">Here, he is!  </span><span id="en19971">Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin," she added, introducing him to Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19974">"I had the pleasure...  </span><span id="en19976">yesterday," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19979">Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.  </span><span id="en19981">Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon.  </span><span id="en19983">Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19986">"Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?"  </span><span id="en19988">she began having recourse to her leading item of conversation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en19991">"To be sure, I heard so.  </span><span id="en19993">I was immediately informed, and I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife's funeral.  </span><span id="en19995">So at least I have excellent authority for believing." </span></p>
<p><span id="en19998">"To Petersburg?  </span><span id="en20000">here?"  </span><span id="en20002">Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20005">"Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20008">"Good heavens!  </span><span id="en20010">won't he leave Dounia in peace even here?"  </span><span id="en20012">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20015">"I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him.  </span><span id="en20017">For my part I am on my guard, and am now discovering where he is lodging." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20020">"Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have given me," Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: "I've only seen him twice, but I thought him terrible, terrible!  </span><span id="en20022">I am convinced that he was the cause of Marfa Petrovna's death." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20025">"It's impossible to be certain about that.  </span><span id="en20027">I have precise information.  </span><span id="en20029">I do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am in agreement with you.  </span><span id="en20031">I do not know whether he is well off now, and precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways.  </span><span id="en20033">He is the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.  </span><span id="en20035">I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years ago, was of service to him also in another way.  </span><span id="en20037">Solely by her exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to Siberia, was hushed up.  </span><span id="en20039">That's the sort of man he is, if you care to know." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20042">"Good heavens!"  </span><span id="en20044">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.  </span><span id="en20046">Raskolnikov listened attentively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20049">"Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of this?"  </span><span id="en20051">Dounia asked sternly and emphatically. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20054">"I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna.  </span><span id="en20056">I must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.  </span><span id="en20058">There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich, a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other commissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close and mysterious relations.  </span><span id="en20060">She had a relation, a niece I believe, living with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than fourteen.  </span><span id="en20062">Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she used to beat her mercilessly.  </span><span id="en20064">One day the girl was found hanging in the garret.  </span><span id="en20066">At the inquest the verdict was suicide.  </span><span id="en20068">After the usual proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that the child had been...  </span><span id="en20070">cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en20072">It is true, this was not clearly established, the information was given by another German woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna's money and exertions; it did not get beyond gossip.  </span><span id="en20074">And yet the story is a very significant one.  </span><span id="en20076">You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20079">"I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20082">"Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him, to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.  </span><span id="en20084">Svidrigaïlov." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20087">"I don't know that," answered Dounia, dryly. " </span><span id="en20089">I only heard a queer story that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher, the servants used to say, 'he read himself silly,' and that he hanged himself partly on account of Mr.  </span><span id="en20091">Svidrigaïlov's mockery of him and not his blows.  </span><span id="en20093">When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for Philip's death." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20096">"I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his defence all of a sudden," Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into an ambiguous smile, "there's no doubt that he is an astute man, and insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has died so strangely, is a terrible instance.  </span><span id="en20098">My only desire has been to be of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him.  </span><span id="en20100">For my part it's my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor's prison again.  </span><span id="en20102">Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on him, having regard for his children's interests, and, if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a man of his habits." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20105">"Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you," said Dounia, "say no more of Mr.  </span><span id="en20107">Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en20109">It makes me miserable." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20112">"He has just been to see me," said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for the first time. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20115">There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him.  </span><span id="en20117">Even Pyotr Petrovitch was roused. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20120">"An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and introduced himself," Raskolnikov continued. " </span><span id="en20122">He was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends.  </span><span id="en20124">He is particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to assist.  </span><span id="en20126">He has a proposition to make to you, and he told me about it.  </span><span id="en20128">He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that you can receive the money very shortly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20131">"Thank God!"  </span><span id="en20133">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. " </span><span id="en20135">Pray for her soul, Dounia!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20138">"It's a fact!"  </span><span id="en20140">broke from Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20143">"Tell us, what more?"  </span><span id="en20145">Dounia urged Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20148">"Then he said that he wasn't rich and all the estate was left to his children who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere not far from me, but where, I don't know, I didn't ask...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20151">"But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?"  </span><span id="en20153">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna in a fright. " </span><span id="en20155">Did he tell you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20158">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20161">"What was it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20164">"I'll tell you afterwards." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20167">Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20170">Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20173">"I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in your way," he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20176">"Don't go, Pyotr Petrovitch," said Dounia, "you intended to spend the evening.  </span><span id="en20178">Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20181">"Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna," Pyotr Petrovitch answered impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. " </span><span id="en20183">I certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed.  </span><span id="en20185">But as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of some proposals of Mr.  </span><span id="en20187">Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not desire and am not able to speak openly...  </span><span id="en20189">in the presence of others...  </span><span id="en20191">of certain matters of the greatest gravity.  </span><span id="en20193">Moreover, my most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20196">Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20199">"Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was disregarded solely at my instance," said Dounia. " </span><span id="en20201">You wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at once, and you must be reconciled.  </span><span id="en20202">And if Rodya really has insulted you, then he  </span><i><span id="en20203">should </span></i><span id="en20204"> and  </span><i><span id="en20205">will </span></i><span id="en20206">  </span><span id="en20207">apologise." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20212">Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20215">"There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us forget.  </span><span id="en20217">There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep; and when it has been overstepped, there is no return." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20220">"That wasn't what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch," Dounia interrupted with some impatience. " </span><span id="en20222">Please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible.  </span><span id="en20224">I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at it in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be.  </span><span id="en20226">I repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20229">"I am surprised at your putting the question like that," said Luzhin, getting more and more irritated. " </span><span id="en20231">Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you, I may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member of your family.  </span><span id="en20233">Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I cannot accept duties incompatible with..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20236">"Ah, don't be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch," Dounia interrupted with feeling, "and be the sensible and generous man I have always considered, and wish to consider, you to be.  </span><span id="en20238">I've given you a great promise, I am your betrothed.  </span><span id="en20240">Trust me in this matter and, believe me, I shall be capable of judging impartially.  </span><span id="en20242">My assuming the part of judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you.  </span><span id="en20244">When I insisted on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told him nothing of what I meant to do.  </span><span id="en20246">Understand that, if you are not reconciled, I must choose between you—it must be either you or he.  </span><span id="en20248">That is how the question rests on your side and on his.  </span><span id="en20250">I don't want to be mistaken in my choice, and I must not be.  </span><span id="en20252">For your sake I must break off with my brother, for my brother's sake I must break off with you.  </span><span id="en20254">I can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me, whether you are the husband for me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20257">"Avdotya Romanovna," Luzhin declared huffily, "your words are of too much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you.  </span><span id="en20259">To say nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an impertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to me.  </span><span id="en20261">You say 'you or he,' showing thereby of how little consequence I am in your eyes...  </span><span id="en20263">I cannot let this pass considering the relationship and...  </span><span id="en20265">the obligations existing between us." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20268">"What!"  </span><span id="en20270">cried Dounia, flushing. " </span><span id="en20271">I set your interest beside all that has hitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the  </span><i><span id="en20272">whole </span></i><span id="en20273"> of my life, and here you are offended at my making too  </span><i><span id="en20274">little </span></i><span id="en20275">  </span><span id="en20276">account of you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20281">Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he became more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20284">"Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to outweigh your love for your brother," he pronounced sententiously, "and in any case I cannot be put on the same level....  </span><span id="en20286">Although I said so emphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother's presence, nevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.  </span><span id="en20288">Your son," he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "yesterday in the presence of Mr.  </span><span id="en20290">Razsudkin (or...  </span><span id="en20292">I think that's it?  </span><span id="en20294">excuse me I have forgotten your surname," he bowed politely to Razumihin) "insulted me by misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation, drinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of view than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable for the moral character.  </span><span id="en20296">Your son intentionally exaggerated the significance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your correspondence with him.  </span><span id="en20298">I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite conclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me.  </span><span id="en20300">Kindly let me know in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion Romanovitch." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20303">"I don't remember," faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. " </span><span id="en20305">I repeated them as I understood them.  </span><span id="en20307">I don't know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps he exaggerated." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20310">"He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20313">"Pyotr Petrovitch," Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, "the proof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is the fact that we are here." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20316">"Good, mother," said Dounia approvingly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20319">"Then this is my fault again," said Luzhin, aggrieved. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20322">"Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have just written what was false about him," Pulcheria Alexandrovna added, gaining courage. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20325">"I don't remember writing anything false." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20328">"You wrote," Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, "that I gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was the fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).  </span><span id="en20330">You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you don't know.  </span><span id="en20332">All that is mean slander." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20335">"Excuse me, sir," said Luzhin, quivering with fury. " </span><span id="en20337">I enlarged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your sister's and mother's inquiries, how I found you, and what impression you made on me.  </span><span id="en20339">As for what you've alluded to in my letter, be so good as to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn't throw away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that family, however unfortunate." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20342">"To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20345">"Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and sister?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20348">"I have done so already, if you care to know.  </span><span id="en20350">I made her sit down to-day with mother and Dounia." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20353">"Rodya!"  </span><span id="en20355">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.  </span><span id="en20357">Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin knitted his brows.  </span><span id="en20359">Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20362">"You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna," he said, "whether it is possible for us to agree.  </span><span id="en20364">I hope now that this question is at an end, once and for all.  </span><span id="en20366">I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets."  </span><span id="en20368">He got up from his chair and took his hat. " </span><span id="en20370">But in withdrawing, I venture to request that for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to say, compromises.  </span><span id="en20372">I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to you and to no one else." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20375">Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20378">"You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en20380">Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded, she had the best intentions.  </span><span id="en20382">And indeed you write as though you were laying commands upon me.  </span><span id="en20384">Are we to consider every desire of yours as a command?  </span><span id="en20386">Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown up everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20389">"That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the present moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna's legacy, which seems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me," he added sarcastically. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20392">"Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were reckoning on our helplessness," Dounia observed irritably. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20395">"But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has entrusted to your brother and which have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest for you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20398">"Good heavens!"  </span><span id="en20400">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20403">Razumihin could not sit still on his chair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20406">"Aren't you ashamed now, sister?"  </span><span id="en20408">asked Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20411">"I am ashamed, Rodya," said Dounia. " </span><span id="en20413">Pyotr Petrovitch, go away," she turned to him, white with anger. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20416">Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.  </span><span id="en20418">He had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the helplessness of his victims.  </span><span id="en20420">He could not believe it even now.  </span><span id="en20422">He turned pale, and his lips quivered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20425">"Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back.  </span><span id="en20427">Consider what you are doing.  </span><span id="en20429">My word is not to be shaken." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20432">"What insolence!"  </span><span id="en20434">cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. " </span><span id="en20436">I don't want you to come back again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20439">"What!  </span><span id="en20441">So that's how it stands!"  </span><span id="en20443">cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now. " </span><span id="en20445">So that's how it stands!  </span><span id="en20447">But do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, that I might protest?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20450">"What right have you to speak to her like that?"  </span><span id="en20452">Pulcheria Alexandrovna intervened hotly. " </span><span id="en20454">And what can you protest about?  </span><span id="en20456">What rights have you?  </span><span id="en20458">Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you?  </span><span id="en20460">Go away, leave us altogether!  </span><span id="en20462">We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above all...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20465">"But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna," Luzhin stormed in a frenzy, "by your promise, and now you deny it and...  </span><span id="en20467">besides...  </span><span id="en20469">I have been led on account of that into expenses...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20472">This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it, could not help breaking into laughter.  </span><span id="en20474">But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was furious. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20477">"Expenses?  </span><span id="en20479">What expenses?  </span><span id="en20481">Are you speaking of our trunk?  </span><span id="en20483">But the conductor brought it for nothing for you.  </span><span id="en20485">Mercy on us, we have bound you!  </span><span id="en20487">What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us, hand and foot, not we!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20490">"Enough, mother, no more please," Avdotya Romanovna implored. " </span><span id="en20492">Pyotr Petrovitch, do be kind and go!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20495">"I am going, but one last word," he said, quite unable to control himself. " </span><span id="en20497">Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my mind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district in regard to your reputation.  </span><span id="en20499">Disregarding public opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly might very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for gratitude on your part.  </span><span id="en20501">And my eyes have only now been opened!  </span><span id="en20503">I see myself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20506">"Does the fellow want his head smashed?"  </span><span id="en20508">cried Razumihin, jumping up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20511">"You are a mean and spiteful man!"  </span><span id="en20513">cried Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20516">"Not a word!  </span><span id="en20518">Not a movement!"  </span><span id="en20520">cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back; then going close up to Luzhin, "Kindly leave the room!"  </span><span id="en20522">he said quietly and distinctly, "and not a word more or..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20525">Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en20527">Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything.  </span><span id="en20529">It is noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, all might "very well indeed" be set right again. </span></p>

<p><span id="en20533">The fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control.  </span><span id="en20535">This conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to the point of fatuity.  </span><span id="en20537">Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in the glass.  </span><span id="en20539">But what he loved and valued above all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his superiors. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20542">When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such "black ingratitude."  </span><span id="en20544">And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip.  </span><span id="en20546">The story had been everywhere contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople, who were warm in Dounia'a defence.  </span><span id="en20548">And he would not have denied that he knew all that at the time.  </span><span id="en20550">Yet he still thought highly of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as something heroic.  </span><span id="en20552">In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too.  </span><span id="en20554">He had called on Raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agreeable flattery.  </span><span id="en20556">And as he went downstairs now, he considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20559">Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.  </span><span id="en20561">For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had gone on waiting and amassing money.  </span><span id="en20563">He brooded with relish, in profound secret, over the image of a girl—virtuous, poor (she must be poor), very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who would all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him and only him.  </span><span id="en20565">How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over!  </span><span id="en20567">And, behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he dreamed of.  </span><span id="en20569">Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute, unbounded power over her!...  </span><span id="en20571">Not long before, he had, too, after long reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and was now entering on a wider circle of business.  </span><span id="en20573">With this change his cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely to be realised....  </span><span id="en20575">He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune in Petersburg.  </span><span id="en20577">He knew that women could do a very great deal.  </span><span id="en20579">The fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing an aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins!  </span><span id="en20581">This sudden horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a hideous joke, an absurdity.  </span><span id="en20583">He had only been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried away—and it had ended so seriously.  </span><span id="en20585">And, of course, too, he did love Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams—and all at once!  </span><span id="en20587">No!  </span><span id="en20589">The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled.  </span><span id="en20591">Above all he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause of it all.  </span><span id="en20593">With a sick feeling he could not help recalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score; as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him!  </span><span id="en20595">The man he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov....  </span><span id="en20597">He had, in short, a great deal to attend to.... </span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en20600">"No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!"  </span><span id="en20602">said Dounia, kissing and embracing her mother. " </span><span id="en20604">I was tempted by his money, but on my honour, brother, I had no idea he was such a base man.  </span><span id="en20606">If I had seen through him before, nothing would have tempted me!  </span><span id="en20608">Don't blame me, brother!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20611">"God has delivered us!  </span><span id="en20613">God has delivered us!"  </span><span id="en20615">Pulcheria Alexandrovna muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what had happened. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20618">They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing.  </span><span id="en20620">Only now and then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.  </span><span id="en20622">Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad: she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible misfortune.  </span><span id="en20624">Razumihin was delighted.  </span><span id="en20626">He did not yet dare to express his joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight had fallen off his heart.  </span><span id="en20628">Now he had the right to devote his life to them, to serve them....  </span><span id="en20630">Anything might happen now!  </span><span id="en20632">But he felt afraid to think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination range.  </span><span id="en20634">But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and indifferent.  </span><span id="en20636">Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened.  </span><span id="en20638">Dounia could not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna watched him timidly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20641">"What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?"  </span><span id="en20643">said Dounia, approaching him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20646">"Yes, yes!"  </span><span id="en20648">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20651">Raskolnikov raised his head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20654">"He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires to see you once in my presence." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20657">"See her!  </span><span id="en20659">On no account!"  </span><span id="en20661">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. " </span><span id="en20663">And how dare he offer her money!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20666">Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with Svidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20669">"What answer did you give him?"  </span><span id="en20671">asked Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20674">"At first I said I would not take any message to you.  </span><span id="en20676">Then he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.  </span><span id="en20678">He assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he has no feeling for you.  </span><span id="en20680">He doesn't want you to marry Luzhin....  </span><span id="en20682">His talk was altogether rather muddled." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20685">"How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya?  </span><span id="en20687">How did he strike you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20690">"I must confess I don't quite understand him.  </span><span id="en20692">He offers you ten thousand, and yet says he is not well off.  </span><span id="en20694">He says he is going away, and in ten minutes he forgets he has said it.  </span><span id="en20696">Then he says is he going to be married and has already fixed on the girl....  </span><span id="en20698">No doubt he has a motive, and probably a bad one.  </span><span id="en20700">But it's odd that he should be so clumsy about it if he had any designs against you....  </span><span id="en20702">Of course, I refused this money on your account, once for all.  </span><span id="en20704">Altogether, I thought him very strange....  </span><span id="en20706">One might almost think he was mad.  </span><span id="en20708">But I may be mistaken; that may only be the part he assumes.  </span><span id="en20710">The death of Marfa Petrovna seems to have made a great impression on him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20713">"God rest her soul," exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. " </span><span id="en20715">I shall always, always pray for her!  </span><span id="en20717">Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three thousand!  </span><span id="en20719">It's as though it had fallen from heaven!  </span><span id="en20721">Why, Rodya, this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man until he offered help." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20724">Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov's offer.  </span><span id="en20726">She still stood meditating. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20729">"He has got some terrible plan," she said in a half whisper to herself, almost shuddering. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20732">Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20735">"I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again," he said to Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20738">"We will watch him!  </span><span id="en20740">I will track him out!"  </span><span id="en20742">cried Razumihin, vigorously. " </span><span id="en20744">I won't lose sight of him.  </span><span id="en20746">Rodya has given me leave.  </span><span id="en20748">He said to me himself just now.  </span><span id="en20750">'Take care of my sister. </span><span id="en20752">' Will you give me leave, too, Avdotya Romanovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20755">Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not leave her face.  </span><span id="en20757">Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20760">A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively conversation.  </span><span id="en20762">Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time, though he did not talk.  </span><span id="en20764">Razumihin was the speaker. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20767">"And why, why should you go away?"  </span><span id="en20769">he flowed on ecstatically. " </span><span id="en20771">And what are you to do in a little town?  </span><span id="en20773">The great thing is, you are all here together and you need one another—you do need one another, believe me.  </span><span id="en20775">For a time, anyway....  </span><span id="en20777">Take me into partnership, and I assure you we'll plan a capital enterprise.  </span><span id="en20779">Listen!  </span><span id="en20781">I'll explain it all in detail to you, the whole project!  </span><span id="en20783">It all flashed into my head this morning, before anything had happened...  </span><span id="en20785">I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must introduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).  </span><span id="en20787">This uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his pension and has no need of that money.  </span><span id="en20789">For the last two years he has been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.  </span><span id="en20791">interest.  </span><span id="en20793">I know what that means; he simply wants to help me.  </span><span id="en20795">Last year I had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as he arrived.  </span><span id="en20797">Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have enough for a start, so we'll go into partnership, and what are we going to do?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20800">Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, sometimes a considerable one.  </span><span id="en20802">Razumihin had, indeed, been dreaming of setting up as a publisher.  </span><span id="en20804">For the last two years he had been working in publishers' offices, and knew three European languages well, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was "schwach" in German with an object of persuading him to take half his translation and half the payment for it.  </span><span id="en20806">He had told a lie then, and Raskolnikov knew he was lying. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20809">"Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief means of success—money of our own!"  </span><span id="en20811">cried Razumihin warmly. " </span><span id="en20813">Of course there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, I, Rodion....  </span><span id="en20815">You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays!  </span><span id="en20817">And the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at once.  </span><span id="en20819">I can be of use because I have experience.  </span><span id="en20821">For nearly two years I've been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every detail of their business.  </span><span id="en20823">You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me!  </span><span id="en20825">And why, why should we let our chance slip!  </span><span id="en20827">Why, I know—and I kept the secret—two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and publishing.  </span><span id="en20829">Indeed, and I would not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them.  </span><span id="en20831">And what do you think?  </span><span id="en20833">If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he'd hesitate—they are such blockheads!  </span><span id="en20835">And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling, you trust to me, I know my way about.  </span><span id="en20837">We'll begin in a small way and go on to a large.  </span><span id="en20839">In any case it will get us our living and we shall get back our capital." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20842">Dounia's eyes shone. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20845">"I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!"  </span><span id="en20847">she said. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20850">"I know nothing about it, of course," put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "it may be a good idea, but again God knows.  </span><span id="en20852">It's new and untried.  </span><span id="en20854">Of course, we must remain here at least for a time."  </span><span id="en20856">She looked at Rodya. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20859">"What do you think, brother?"  </span><span id="en20861">said Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20864">"I think he's got a very good idea," he answered. " </span><span id="en20866">Of course, it's too soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of success.  </span><span id="en20868">I know of one book myself which would be sure to go well.  </span><span id="en20870">And as for his being able to manage it, there's no doubt about that either.  </span><span id="en20872">He knows the business....  </span><span id="en20874">But we can talk it over later...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en20877">"Hurrah!"  </span><span id="en20879">cried Razumihin. " </span><span id="en20881">Now, stay, there's a flat here in this house, belonging to the same owner.  </span><span id="en20883">It's a special flat apart, not communicating with these lodgings.  </span><span id="en20885">It's furnished, rent moderate, three rooms.  </span><span id="en20887">Suppose you take them to begin with.  </span><span id="en20889">I'll pawn your watch to-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.  </span><span id="en20891">You can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you.  </span><span id="en20893">But where are you off to, Rodya?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20896">"What, Rodya, you are going already?"  </span><span id="en20898">Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in dismay. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20901">"At such a minute?"  </span><span id="en20903">cried Razumihin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20906">Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder.  </span><span id="en20908">He held his cap in his hand, he was preparing to leave them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20911">"One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever," he said somewhat oddly.  </span><span id="en20913">He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a smile. " </span><span id="en20915">But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each other..."  </span><span id="en20917">he let slip accidentally.  </span><span id="en20919">It was what he was thinking, and it somehow was uttered aloud. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20922">"What is the matter with you?"  </span><span id="en20924">cried his mother. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20927">"Where are you going, Rodya?"  </span><span id="en20929">asked Dounia rather strangely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20932">"Oh, I'm quite obliged to..."  </span><span id="en20934">he answered vaguely, as though hesitating what he would say.  </span><span id="en20936">But there was a look of sharp determination in his white face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20939">"I meant to say...  </span><span id="en20941">as I was coming here...  </span><span id="en20943">I meant to tell you, mother, and you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time.  </span><span id="en20945">I feel ill, I am not at peace....  </span><span id="en20947">I will come afterwards, I will come of myself...  </span><span id="en20949">when it's possible.  </span><span id="en20951">I remember you and love you....  </span><span id="en20953">Leave me, leave me alone.  </span><span id="en20955">I decided this even before...  </span><span id="en20957">I'm absolutely resolved on it.  </span><span id="en20959">Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be alone.  </span><span id="en20961">Forget me altogether, it's better.  </span><span id="en20963">Don't inquire about me.  </span><span id="en20965">When I can, I'll come of myself or...  </span><span id="en20967">I'll send for you.  </span><span id="en20969">Perhaps it will all come back, but now if you love me, give me up...  </span><span id="en20971">else I shall begin to hate you, I feel it....  </span><span id="en20973">Good-bye!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en20976">"Good God!"  </span><span id="en20978">cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.  </span><span id="en20980">Both his mother and his sister were terribly alarmed.  </span><span id="en20982">Razumihin was also. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20985">"Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us!  </span><span id="en20987">Let us be as before!"  </span><span id="en20989">cried his poor mother. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20992">He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room.  </span><span id="en20994">Dounia overtook him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en20997">"Brother, what are you doing to mother?"  </span><span id="en20999">she whispered, her eyes flashing with indignation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21002">He looked dully at her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21005">"No matter, I shall come....  </span><span id="en21007">I'm coming," he muttered in an undertone, as though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21010">"Wicked, heartless egoist!"  </span><span id="en21012">cried Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21015">"He is insane, but not heartless.  </span><span id="en21017">He is mad!  </span><span id="en21019">Don't you see it?  </span><span id="en21021">You're heartless after that!"  </span><span id="en21023">Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing her hand tightly. " </span><span id="en21025">I shall be back directly," he shouted to the horror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21028">Raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21031">"I knew you would run after me," he said. " </span><span id="en21033">Go back to them—be with them...  </span><span id="en21035">be with them to-morrow and always....  </span><span id="en21037">I...  </span><span id="en21039">perhaps I shall come...  </span><span id="en21041">if I can.  </span><span id="en21043">Good-bye." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21046">And without holding out his hand he walked away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21049">"But where are you going?  </span><span id="en21051">What are you doing?  </span><span id="en21053">What's the matter with you?  </span><span id="en21055">How can you go on like this?"  </span><span id="en21057">Razumihin muttered, at his wits' end. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21060">Raskolnikov stopped once more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21063">"Once for all, never ask me about anything.  </span><span id="en21065">I have nothing to tell you.  </span><span id="en21067">Don't come to see me.  </span><span id="en21069">Maybe I'll come here....  </span><span id="en21070">Leave me, but  </span><i><span id="en21071">don't leave </span></i><span id="en21072">  </span><span id="en21073">them.  </span><span id="en21075">Do you understand me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21079">It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp.  </span><span id="en21081">For a minute they were looking at one another in silence.  </span><span id="en21083">Razumihin remembered that minute all his life.  </span><span id="en21085">Raskolnikov's burning and intent eyes grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his consciousness.  </span><span id="en21087">Suddenly Razumihin started.  </span><span id="en21089">Something strange, as it were, passed between them....  </span><span id="en21091">Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped, something awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....  </span><span id="en21093">Razumihin turned pale. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21096">"Do you understand now?"  </span><span id="en21098">said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously. " </span><span id="en21100">Go back, go to them," he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went out of the house. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21103">I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies, how he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his illness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated, that he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the best doctor, a consultation....  </span><span id="en21105">In fact from that evening Razumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother. </span></p>

<p><span id="en21109">Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia lived.  </span><span id="en21111">It was an old green house of three storeys.  </span><span id="en21113">He found the porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of Kapernaumov, the tailor.  </span><span id="en21115">Having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey over the yard.  </span><span id="en21117">While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where to turn for Kapernaumov's door, a door opened three paces from him; he mechanically took hold of it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21120">"Who is there?"  </span><span id="en21122">a woman's voice asked uneasily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21125">"It's I...  </span><span id="en21127">come to see you," answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the tiny entry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21130">On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21133">"It's you!  </span><span id="en21135">Good heavens!"  </span><span id="en21137">cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to the spot. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21140">"Which is your room?  </span><span id="en21142">This way?"  </span><span id="en21144">and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at her, hastened in. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21147">A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit.  </span><span id="en21149">The colour rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes...  </span><span id="en21151">She felt sick and ashamed and happy, too....  </span><span id="en21153">Raskolnikov turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table.  </span><span id="en21155">He scanned the room in a rapid glance. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21158">It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.  </span><span id="en21160">In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always kept locked.  </span><span id="en21162">That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.  </span><span id="en21164">Sonia's room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and this gave it a grotesque appearance.  </span><span id="en21166">A wall with three windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.  </span><span id="en21168">The other corner was disproportionately obtuse.  </span><span id="en21170">There was scarcely any furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead, beside it, nearest the door, a chair.  </span><span id="en21172">A plain, deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other flat.  </span><span id="en21174">Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table.  </span><span id="en21176">On the opposite wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking, as it were, lost in a desert.  </span><span id="en21178">That was all there was in the room.  </span><span id="en21180">The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the corners.  </span><span id="en21182">It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter.  </span><span id="en21184">There was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21187">Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21190">"I am late....  </span><span id="en21192">It's eleven, isn't it?"  </span><span id="en21194">he asked, still not lifting his eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21197">"Yes," muttered Sonia, "oh yes, it is," she added, hastily, as though in that lay her means of escape. " </span><span id="en21199">My landlady's clock has just struck...  </span><span id="en21201">I heard it myself...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21204">"I've come to you for the last time," Raskolnikov went on gloomily, although this was the first time. " </span><span id="en21206">I may perhaps not see you again..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21209">"Are you...  </span><span id="en21211">going away?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21214">"I don't know...  </span><span id="en21216">to-morrow...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21219">"Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?"  </span><span id="en21221">Sonia's voice shook. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21224">"I don't know.  </span><span id="en21226">I shall know to-morrow morning....  </span><span id="en21228">Never mind that: I've come to say one word...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21231">He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was sitting down while she was all the while standing before him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21234">"Why are you standing?  </span><span id="en21236">Sit down," he said in a changed voice, gentle and friendly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21239">She sat down.  </span><span id="en21241">He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21244">"How thin you are!  </span><span id="en21246">What a hand!  </span><span id="en21248">Quite transparent, like a dead hand." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21251">He took her hand.  </span><span id="en21253">Sonia smiled faintly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21256">"I have always been like that," she said. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21259">"Even when you lived at home?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21262">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21265">"Of course, you were," he added abruptly and the expression of his face and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21268">He looked round him once more. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21271">"You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21274">"Yes...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21277">"They live there, through that door?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21280">"Yes....  </span><span id="en21282">They have another room like this." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21285">"All in one room?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21288">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21291">"I should be afraid in your room at night," he observed gloomily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21294">"They are very good people, very kind," answered Sonia, who still seemed bewildered, "and all the furniture, everything...  </span><span id="en21296">everything is theirs.  </span><span id="en21298">And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21301">"They all stammer, don't they?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21304">"Yes....  </span><span id="en21306">He stammers and he's lame.  </span><span id="en21308">And his wife, too....  </span><span id="en21310">It's not exactly that she stammers, but she can't speak plainly.  </span><span id="en21312">She is a very kind woman.  </span><span id="en21314">And he used to be a house serf.  </span><span id="en21316">And there are seven children...  </span><span id="en21318">and it's only the eldest one that stammers and the others are simply ill...  </span><span id="en21320">but they don't stammer....  </span><span id="en21322">But where did you hear about them?"  </span><span id="en21324">she added with some surprise. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21327">"Your father told me, then.  </span><span id="en21329">He told me all about you....  </span><span id="en21331">And how you went out at six o'clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna knelt down by your bed." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21334">Sonia was confused. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21337">"I fancied I saw him to-day," she whispered hesitatingly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21340">"Whom?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21343">"Father.  </span><span id="en21345">I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten o'clock and he seemed to be walking in front.  </span><span id="en21347">It looked just like him.  </span><span id="en21349">I wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21352">"You were walking in the streets?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21355">"Yes," Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and looking down. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21358">"Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21361">"Oh no, what are you saying?  </span><span id="en21363">No!"  </span><span id="en21365">Sonia looked at him almost with dismay. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21368">"You love her, then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21371">"Love her?  </span><span id="en21373">Of course!"  </span><span id="en21375">said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she clasped her hands in distress. " </span><span id="en21377">Ah, you don't....  </span><span id="en21379">If you only knew!  </span><span id="en21381">You see, she is quite like a child....  </span><span id="en21383">Her mind is quite unhinged, you see...  </span><span id="en21385">from sorrow.  </span><span id="en21387">And how clever she used to be...  </span><span id="en21389">how generous...  </span><span id="en21391">how kind!  </span><span id="en21393">Ah, you don't understand, you don't understand!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21396">Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement and distress.  </span><span id="en21398">Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in her eyes.  </span><span id="en21400">It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something.  </span><span id="en21401">A sort of  </span><i><span id="en21402">insatiable </span></i><span id="en21403">  </span><span id="en21404">compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in every feature of her face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21408">"Beat me!  </span><span id="en21410">how can you?  </span><span id="en21412">Good heavens, beat me!  </span><span id="en21414">And if she did beat me, what then?  </span><span id="en21416">What of it?  </span><span id="en21418">You know nothing, nothing about it....  </span><span id="en21420">She is so unhappy...  </span><span id="en21422">ah, how unhappy!  </span><span id="en21424">And ill....  </span><span id="en21426">She is seeking righteousness, she is pure.  </span><span id="en21428">She has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere and she expects it....  </span><span id="en21430">And if you were to torture her, she wouldn't do wrong.  </span><span id="en21432">She doesn't see that it's impossible for people to be righteous and she is angry at it.  </span><span id="en21434">Like a child, like a child.  </span><span id="en21436">She is good!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21439">"And what will happen to you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21442">Sonia looked at him inquiringly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21445">"They are left on your hands, you see.  </span><span id="en21447">They were all on your hands before, though....  </span><span id="en21449">And your father came to you to beg for drink.  </span><span id="en21451">Well, how will it be now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21454">"I don't know," Sonia articulated mournfully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21457">"Will they stay there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21460">"I don't know....  </span><span id="en21462">They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady, I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina Ivanovna says that she won't stay another minute." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21465">"How is it she is so bold?  </span><span id="en21467">She relies upon you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21470">"Oh, no, don't talk like that....  </span><span id="en21472">We are one, we live like one."  </span><span id="en21474">Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry. " </span><span id="en21476">And what could she do?  </span><span id="en21478">What, what could she do?"  </span><span id="en21480">she persisted, getting hot and excited. " </span><span id="en21482">And how she cried to-day!  </span><span id="en21484">Her mind is unhinged, haven't you noticed it?  </span><span id="en21486">At one minute she is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the lunch and all that....  </span><span id="en21488">Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the wall, in despair.  </span><span id="en21490">Then she will be comforted again.  </span><span id="en21492">She builds all her hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life.  </span><span id="en21494">And she kisses and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in her fancies!  </span><span id="en21496">One can't contradict her.  </span><span id="en21498">And all the day long she has been washing, cleaning, mending.  </span><span id="en21500">She dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath.  </span><span id="en21502">We went this morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are quite worn out.  </span><span id="en21504">Only the money we'd reckoned wasn't enough, not nearly enough.  </span><span id="en21506">And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste, you don't know.  </span><span id="en21508">And there in the shop she burst out crying before the shopmen because she hadn't enough....  </span><span id="en21510">Ah, it was sad to see her...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21513">"Well, after that I can understand your living like this," Raskolnikov said with a bitter smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21516">"And aren't you sorry for them?  </span><span id="en21518">Aren't you sorry?"  </span><span id="en21520">Sonia flew at him again. " </span><span id="en21522">Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you'd seen nothing of it, and if you'd seen everything, oh dear!  </span><span id="en21524">And how often, how often I've brought her to tears!  </span><span id="en21526">Only last week!  </span><span id="en21528">Yes, I!  </span><span id="en21530">Only a week before his death.  </span><span id="en21532">I was cruel!  </span><span id="en21534">And how often I've done it!  </span><span id="en21536">Ah, I've been wretched at the thought of it all day!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21539">Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21542">"You were cruel?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21545">"Yes, I—I.  </span><span id="en21547">I went to see them," she went on, weeping, "and father said, 'read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here's a book. </span><span id="en21549">' He had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives there, he always used to get hold of such funny books.  </span><span id="en21551">And I said, 'I can't stay,' as I didn't want to read, and I'd gone in chiefly to show Katerina Ivanovna some collars.  </span><span id="en21553">Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones.  </span><span id="en21555">Katerina Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with them.  </span><span id="en21557">'Make me a present of them, Sonia,' she said, 'please do. </span><span id="en21558">' ' </span><i><span id="en21559">Please do </span></i><span id="en21561">,' she said, she wanted them so much.  </span><span id="en21563">And when could she wear them?  </span><span id="en21565">They just reminded her of her old happy days.  </span><span id="en21567">She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn't had all these years!  </span><span id="en21569">And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she'd sooner give away everything.  </span><span id="en21571">And these she asked for, she liked them so much.  </span><span id="en21573">And I was sorry to give them.  </span><span id="en21575">'What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna? </span><span id="en21577">' I said.  </span><span id="en21579">I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that!  </span><span id="en21581">She gave me such a look.  </span><span id="en21583">And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.  </span><span id="en21585">And it was so sad to see....  </span><span id="en21587">And she was not grieved for the collars, but for my refusing, I saw that.  </span><span id="en21589">Ah, if only I could bring it all back, change it, take back those words!  </span><span id="en21591">Ah, if I...  </span><span id="en21593">but it's nothing to you!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21597">"Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21600">"Yes....  </span><span id="en21602">Did you know her?"  </span><span id="en21604">Sonia asked with some surprise. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21607">"Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon die," said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21610">"Oh, no, no, no!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21613">And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring that she should not. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21616">"But it will be better if she does die." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21619">"No, not better, not at all better!"  </span><span id="en21621">Sonia unconsciously repeated in dismay. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21624">"And the children?  </span><span id="en21626">What can you do except take them to live with you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21629">"Oh, I don't know," cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her hands to her head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21632">It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and he had only roused it again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21635">"And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?"  </span><span id="en21637">he persisted pitilessly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21640">"How can you?  </span><span id="en21642">That cannot be!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21645">And Sonia's face worked with awful terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21648">"Cannot be?"  </span><span id="en21650">Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. " </span><span id="en21652">You are not insured against it, are you?  </span><span id="en21654">What will happen to them then?  </span><span id="en21656">They will be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....  </span><span id="en21658">Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the hospital, she will die, and the children..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21661">"Oh, no....  </span><span id="en21663">God will not let it be!"  </span><span id="en21665">broke at last from Sonia's overburdened bosom. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21668">She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb entreaty, as though it all depended upon him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21671">Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room.  </span><span id="en21673">A minute passed.  </span><span id="en21675">Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible dejection. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21678">"And can't you save?  </span><span id="en21680">Put by for a rainy day?"  </span><span id="en21682">he asked, stopping suddenly before her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21685">"No," whispered Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21688">"Of course not.  </span><span id="en21690">Have you tried?"  </span><span id="en21692">he added almost ironically. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21695">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21698">"And it didn't come off!  </span><span id="en21700">Of course not!  </span><span id="en21702">No need to ask." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21705">And again he paced the room.  </span><span id="en21707">Another minute passed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21710">"You don't get money every day?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21713">Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21716">"No," she whispered with a painful effort. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21719">"It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt," he said suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21722">"No, no!  </span><span id="en21724">It can't be, no!"  </span><span id="en21726">Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though she had been stabbed. " </span><span id="en21728">God would not allow anything so awful!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21731">"He lets others come to it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21734">"No, no!  </span><span id="en21736">God will protect her, God!"  </span><span id="en21738">she repeated beside herself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21741">"But, perhaps, there is no God at all," Raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance, laughed and looked at her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21744">Sonia's face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it.  </span><span id="en21746">She looked at him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21749">"You say Katerina Ivanovna's mind is unhinged; your own mind is unhinged," he said after a brief silence. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21752">Five minutes passed.  </span><span id="en21754">He still paced up and down the room in silence, not looking at her.  </span><span id="en21756">At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered.  </span><span id="en21758">He put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face.  </span><span id="en21760">His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were twitching.  </span><span id="en21762">All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her foot.  </span><span id="en21764">Sonia drew back from him as from a madman.  </span><span id="en21766">And certainly he looked like a madman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21769">"What are you doing to me?"  </span><span id="en21771">she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21774">He stood up at once. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21777">"I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity," he said wildly and walked away to the window. " </span><span id="en21779">Listen," he added, turning to her a minute later. " </span><span id="en21781">I said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your little finger...  </span><span id="en21783">and that I did my sister honour making her sit beside you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21786">"Ach, you said that to them!  </span><span id="en21788">And in her presence?"  </span><span id="en21790">cried Sonia, frightened. " </span><span id="en21792">Sit down with me!  </span><span id="en21794">An honour!  </span><span id="en21796">Why, I'm...  </span><span id="en21798">dishonourable....  </span><span id="en21800">Ah, why did you say that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21803">"It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you, but because of your great suffering.  </span><span id="en21804">But you are a great sinner, that's true," he added almost solemnly, "and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself  </span><i><span id="en21805">for nothing </span></i><span id="en21807">. Isn't that fearful?  </span><span id="en21809">Isn't it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time you know yourself (you've only to open your eyes) that you are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything?  </span><span id="en21811">Tell me," he went on almost in a frenzy, "how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings?  </span><span id="en21813">It would be better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21817">"But what would become of them?"  </span><span id="en21819">Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21822">Raskolnikov looked strangely at her.  </span><span id="en21824">He read it all in her face; so she must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion.  </span><span id="en21826">She had not even noticed the cruelty of his words.  </span><span id="en21828">(The significance of his reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either, and that, too, was clear to him. </span><span id="en21830">) But he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her. " </span><span id="en21832">What, what," he thought, "could hitherto have hindered her from putting an end to it?"  </span><span id="en21834">Only then he realised what those poor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna, knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21837">But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any case remain so.  </span><span id="en21839">He was still confronted by the question, how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind, since she could not bring herself to jump into the water?  </span><span id="en21841">Of course he knew that Sonia's position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought, have killed her at the first step on that revolting path.  </span><span id="en21843">What held her up—surely not depravity?  </span><span id="en21845">All that infamy had obviously only touched her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart; he saw that.  </span><span id="en21847">He saw through her as she stood before him.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en21850">"There are three ways before her," he thought, "the canal, the madhouse, or...  </span><span id="en21852">at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21855">The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21858">"But can that be true?"  </span><span id="en21860">he cried to himself. " </span><span id="en21862">Can that creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity?  </span><span id="en21864">Can the process already have begun?  </span><span id="en21866">Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now, because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her?  </span><span id="en21868">No, no, that cannot be!"  </span><span id="en21870">he cried, as Sonia had just before. " </span><span id="en21872">No, what has kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children....  </span><span id="en21874">And if she has not gone out of her mind...  </span><span id="en21876">but who says she has not gone out of her mind?  </span><span id="en21878">Is she in her senses?  </span><span id="en21880">Can one talk, can one reason as she does?  </span><span id="en21882">How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger?  </span><span id="en21884">Does she expect a miracle?  </span><span id="en21886">No doubt she does.  </span><span id="en21888">Doesn't that all mean madness?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21891">He stayed obstinately at that thought.  </span><span id="en21893">He liked that explanation indeed better than any other.  </span><span id="en21895">He began looking more intently at her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21898">"So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?"  </span><span id="en21900">he asked her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21903">Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21906">"What should I be without God?"  </span><span id="en21908">she whispered rapidly, forcibly, glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21911">"Ah, so that is it!"  </span><span id="en21913">he thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21916">"And what does God do for you?"  </span><span id="en21918">he asked, probing her further. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21921">Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer.  </span><span id="en21923">Her weak chest kept heaving with emotion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21926">"Be silent!  </span><span id="en21928">Don't ask!  </span><span id="en21930">You don't deserve!"  </span><span id="en21932">she cried suddenly, looking sternly and wrathfully at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21935">"That's it, that's it," he repeated to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21938">"He does everything," she whispered quickly, looking down again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21941">"That's the way out!  </span><span id="en21943">That's the explanation," he decided, scrutinising her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.  </span><span id="en21945">He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that little body still shaking with indignation and anger—and it all seemed to him more and more strange, almost impossible. " </span><span id="en21947">She is a religious maniac!"  </span><span id="en21949">he repeated to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21952">There was a book lying on the chest of drawers.  </span><span id="en21954">He had noticed it every time he paced up and down the room.  </span><span id="en21956">Now he took it up and looked at it.  </span><span id="en21958">It was the New Testament in the Russian translation.  </span><span id="en21960">It was bound in leather, old and worn. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21963">"Where did you get that?"  </span><span id="en21965">he called to her across the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21968">She was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21971">"It was brought me," she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21974">"Who brought it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en21977">"Lizaveta, I asked her for it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en21980">"Lizaveta!  </span><span id="en21982">strange!"  </span><span id="en21984">he thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21987">Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment.  </span><span id="en21989">He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21992">"Where is the story of Lazarus?"  </span><span id="en21994">he asked suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en21997">Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer.  </span><span id="en21999">She was standing sideways to the table. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22002">"Where is the raising of Lazarus?  </span><span id="en22004">Find it for me, Sonia." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22007">She stole a glance at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22010">"You are not looking in the right place....  </span><span id="en22012">It's in the fourth gospel," she whispered sternly, without looking at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22015">"Find it and read it to me," he said.  </span><span id="en22017">He sat down with his elbow on the table, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to listen. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22020">"In three weeks' time they'll welcome me in the madhouse!  </span><span id="en22022">I shall be there if I am not in a worse place," he muttered to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22025">Sonia heard Raskolnikov's request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table.  </span><span id="en22027">She took the book however. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22030">"Haven't you read it?"  </span><span id="en22032">she asked, looking up at him across the table. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22035">Her voice became sterner and sterner. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22038">"Long ago....  </span><span id="en22040">When I was at school.  </span><span id="en22042">Read!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22045">"And haven't you heard it in church?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22048">"I...  </span><span id="en22050">haven't been.  </span><span id="en22052">Do you often go?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22055">"N-no," whispered Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22058">Raskolnikov smiled. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22061">"I understand....  </span><span id="en22063">And you won't go to your father's funeral to-morrow?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22066">"Yes, I shall.  </span><span id="en22068">I was at church last week, too...  </span><span id="en22070">I had a requiem service." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22073">"For whom?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22076">"For Lizaveta.  </span><span id="en22078">She was killed with an axe." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22081">His nerves were more and more strained.  </span><span id="en22083">His head began to go round. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22086">"Were you friends with Lizaveta?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22089">"Yes....  </span><span id="en22091">She was good...  </span><span id="en22093">she used to come...  </span><span id="en22095">not often...  </span><span id="en22097">she couldn't....  </span><span id="en22099">We used to read together and...  </span><span id="en22101">talk.  </span><span id="en22103">She will see God." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22106">The last phrase sounded strange in his ears.  </span><span id="en22108">And here was something new again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them—religious maniacs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22111">"I shall be a religious maniac myself soon!  </span><span id="en22113">It's infectious!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22116">"Read!"  </span><span id="en22118">he cried irritably and insistently. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22121">Sonia still hesitated.  </span><span id="en22123">Her heart was throbbing.  </span><span id="en22125">She hardly dared to read to him.  </span><span id="en22127">He looked almost with exasperation at the "unhappy lunatic." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22130">"What for?  </span><span id="en22132">You don't believe?..."  </span><span id="en22134">she whispered softly and as it were breathlessly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22137">"Read!  </span><span id="en22139">I want you to," he persisted. " </span><span id="en22141">You used to read to Lizaveta." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22144">Sonia opened the book and found the place.  </span><span id="en22146">Her hands were shaking, her voice failed her.  </span><span id="en22148">Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22151">"Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany..."  </span><span id="en22153">she forced herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an overstrained string.  </span><span id="en22155">There was a catch in her breath. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22158">Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so.  </span><span id="en22159">He understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her  </span><i><span id="en22160">own </span></i><span id="en22161">. He understood that these feelings really were her  </span><i><span id="en22162">secret treasure </span></i><span id="en22164">, which she had kept perhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches.  </span><span id="en22165">But at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to  </span><i><span id="en22166">him </span></i><span id="en22167"> that he might hear it, and to read  </span><i><span id="en22168">now </span></i><span id="en22169">  </span><span id="en22170">whatever might come of it!...  </span><span id="en22172">He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.  </span><span id="en22174">She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of St.  </span><span id="en22176">John.  </span><span id="en22177">She went on to the nineteenth verse: </span></p>
<p><span id="en22183">"And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22186">"Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met Him: but Mary sat still in the house. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22189">"Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22192">"But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22195">Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would quiver and break again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22198">"Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22201">"Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection, at the last day. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22204">"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22207">"And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die.  </span><span id="en22209">Believest thou this? </span></p>
<p><span id="en22211">"She saith unto Him," </span></p>
<p><span id="en22213">(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as though she were making a public confession of faith. </span><span id="en22214">) </span></p>
<p><span id="en22216">"Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which should come into the world." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22219">She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went on reading.  </span><span id="en22221">Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away.  </span><span id="en22223">She read to the thirty-second verse. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22226">"Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22228">"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled, </span></p>
<p><span id="en22230">"And said, Where have ye laid him?  </span><span id="en22232">They said unto Him, Lord, come and see. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22235">"Jesus wept. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22238">"Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him! </span></p>
<p><span id="en22241">"And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22244">Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion.  </span><span id="en22246">Yes, he had known it!  </span><span id="en22248">She was trembling in a real physical fever.  </span><span id="en22250">He had expected it.  </span><span id="en22252">She was getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came over her.  </span><span id="en22254">Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy gave it power.  </span><span id="en22256">The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she was reading by heart.  </span><span id="en22258">At the last verse "Could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind..."  </span><span id="en22260">dropping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by thunder, sobbing and believing.... " </span><span id="en22261">And  </span><i><span id="en22262">he, he </span></i><span id="en22264">—too, is blinded and unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes!  </span><span id="en22266">At once, now," was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy anticipation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22270">"Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave.  </span><span id="en22272">It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22275">"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone.  </span><span id="en22277">Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22279">She laid emphasis on the word  </span><i><span id="en22280">four </span></i><span id="en22281">. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22284">"Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? </span></p>
<p><span id="en22287">"Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.  </span><span id="en22289">And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22292">"And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22295">"And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22298">"And he that was dead came forth." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22301">(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were seeing it before her eyes. </span><span id="en22302">) </span></p>
<p><span id="en22304">"Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin.  </span><span id="en22306">Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22309">"Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on Him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22312">She could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair quickly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22315">"That is all about the raising of Lazarus," she whispered severely and abruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise her eyes to him.  </span><span id="en22317">She still trembled feverishly.  </span><span id="en22319">The candle-end was flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book.  </span><span id="en22321">Five minutes or more passed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22324">"I came to speak of something," Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning.  </span><span id="en22326">He got up and went to Sonia.  </span><span id="en22328">She lifted her eyes to him in silence.  </span><span id="en22330">His face was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22333">"I have abandoned my family to-day," he said, "my mother and sister.  </span><span id="en22335">I am not going to see them.  </span><span id="en22337">I've broken with them completely." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22340">"What for?"  </span><span id="en22342">asked Sonia amazed.  </span><span id="en22344">Her recent meeting with his mother and sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse.  </span><span id="en22346">She heard his news almost with horror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22349">"I have only you now," he added. " </span><span id="en22351">Let us go together....  </span><span id="en22353">I've come to you, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22356">His eyes glittered "as though he were mad," Sonia thought, in her turn. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22359">"Go where?"  </span><span id="en22361">she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22364">"How do I know?  </span><span id="en22366">I only know it's the same road, I know that and nothing more.  </span><span id="en22368">It's the same goal!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22371">She looked at him and understood nothing.  </span><span id="en22373">She knew only that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22376">"No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have understood.  </span><span id="en22378">I need you, that is why I have come to you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22381">"I don't understand," whispered Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22384">"You'll understand later.  </span><span id="en22386">Haven't you done the same?  </span><span id="en22388">You, too, have transgressed...  </span><span id="en22390">have had the strength to transgress.  </span><span id="en22392">You have laid hands on yourself, you have destroyed a life...  </span><i><span id="en22394">your own </span></i><span id="en22395">  </span><span id="en22396">(it's all the same! </span><span id="en22398">).  </span><span id="en22400">You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you'll end in the Hay Market....  </span><span id="en22402">But you won't be able to stand it, and if you remain alone you'll go out of your mind like me.  </span><span id="en22404">You are like a mad creature already.  </span><span id="en22406">So we must go together on the same road!  </span><span id="en22408">Let us go!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22412">"What for?  </span><span id="en22414">What's all this for?"  </span><span id="en22416">said Sonia, strangely and violently agitated by his words. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22419">"What for?  </span><span id="en22421">Because you can't remain like this, that's why!  </span><span id="en22423">You must look things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry that God won't allow it.  </span><span id="en22425">What will happen, if you should really be taken to the hospital to-morrow?  </span><span id="en22427">She is mad and in consumption, she'll soon die and the children?  </span><span id="en22429">Do you mean to tell me Polenka won't come to grief?  </span><span id="en22431">Haven't you seen children here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg?  </span><span id="en22433">I've found out where those mothers live and in what surroundings.  </span><span id="en22435">Children can't remain children there!  </span><span id="en22437">At seven the child is vicious and a thief.  </span><span id="en22439">Yet children, you know, are the image of Christ: 'theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. </span><span id="en22441">' He bade us honour and love them, they are the humanity of the future...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22444">"What's to be done, what's to be done?"  </span><span id="en22446">repeated Sonia, weeping hysterically and wringing her hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22449">"What's to be done?  </span><span id="en22451">Break what must be broken, once for all, that's all, and take the suffering on oneself.  </span><span id="en22453">What, you don't understand?  </span><span id="en22455">You'll understand later....  </span><span id="en22457">Freedom and power, and above all, power!  </span><span id="en22459">Over all trembling creation and all the ant-heap!...  </span><span id="en22461">That's the goal, remember that!  </span><span id="en22463">That's my farewell message.  </span><span id="en22465">Perhaps it's the last time I shall speak to you.  </span><span id="en22467">If I don't come to-morrow, you'll hear of it all, and then remember these words.  </span><span id="en22469">And some day later on, in years to come, you'll understand perhaps what they meant.  </span><span id="en22471">If I come to-morrow, I'll tell you who killed Lizaveta....  </span><span id="en22473">Good-bye." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22476">Sonia started with terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22479">"Why, do you know who killed her?"  </span><span id="en22481">she asked, chilled with horror, looking wildly at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22484">"I know and will tell...  </span><span id="en22486">you, only you.  </span><span id="en22488">I have chosen you out.  </span><span id="en22490">I'm not coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you.  </span><span id="en22492">I chose you out long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it.  </span><span id="en22494">Good-bye, don't shake hands.  </span><span id="en22496">To-morrow!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22499">He went out.  </span><span id="en22501">Sonia gazed at him as at a madman.  </span><span id="en22503">But she herself was like one insane and felt it.  </span><span id="en22505">Her head was going round. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22508">"Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta?  </span><span id="en22510">What did those words mean?  </span><span id="en22512">It's awful!"  </span><span id="en22513">But at the same time  </span><i><span id="en22514">the idea </span></i><span id="en22515">  </span><span id="en22516">did not enter her head, not for a moment! " </span><span id="en22518">Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!...  </span><span id="en22520">He has abandoned his mother and sister....  </span><span id="en22522">What for?  </span><span id="en22524">What has happened?  </span><span id="en22526">And what had he in his mind?  </span><span id="en22528">What did he say to her?  </span><span id="en22530">He had kissed her foot and said...  </span><span id="en22532">said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live without her....  </span><span id="en22534">Oh, merciful heavens!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22538">Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious.  </span><span id="en22540">She jumped up from time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading the gospel and him...  </span><span id="en22542">him with pale face, with burning eyes...  </span><span id="en22544">kissing her feet, weeping. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22547">On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia's room from Madame Resslich's flat, was a room which had long stood empty.  </span><span id="en22549">A card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let.  </span><span id="en22551">Sonia had long been accustomed to the room's being uninhabited.  </span><span id="en22553">But all that time Mr.  </span><span id="en22555">Svidrigaïlov had been standing, listening at the door of the empty room.  </span><span id="en22557">When Raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the door that led to Sonia's room.  </span><span id="en22559">The conversation had struck him as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it—so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might listen in comfort. </span></p>

<p><span id="en22563">When next morning at eleven o'clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long: it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned.  </span><span id="en22565">He had expected that they would pounce upon him.  </span><span id="en22567">But he stood in the waiting-room, and people, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually passing to and fro before him.  </span><span id="en22569">In the next room which looked like an office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be.  </span><span id="en22571">He looked uneasily and suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape.  </span><span id="en22573">But there was nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.  </span><span id="en22575">He might go where he liked for them.  </span><span id="en22577">The conviction grew stronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait like that.  </span><span id="en22579">And would they have waited till he elected to appear at eleven?  </span><span id="en22581">Either the man had not yet given information, or...  </span><span id="en22583">or simply he knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything? </span><span id="en22585">) and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination.  </span><span id="en22587">This conjecture had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his alarm and despair.  </span><span id="en22589">Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling—and he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en22591">What he dreaded above all was meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred and was afraid his hatred might betray him.  </span><span id="en22593">His indignation was such that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible, to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained nerves.  </span><span id="en22595">At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22598">He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study.  </span><span id="en22600">His study was a room neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a bookcase in the corner and several chairs—all government furniture, of polished yellow wood.  </span><span id="en22602">In the further wall there was a closed door, beyond it there were no doubt other rooms.  </span><span id="en22604">On Raskolnikov's entrance Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in and they remained alone.  </span><span id="en22606">He met his visitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22609">"Ah, my dear fellow!  </span><span id="en22611">Here you are...  </span><span id="en22613">in our domain"...  </span><span id="en22615">began Porfiry, holding out both hands to him. " </span><span id="en22617">Come, sit down, old man...  </span><span id="en22619">or perhaps you don't like to be called 'my dear fellow' and 'old man! </span><span id="en22620">'— </span><i><span id="en22621">tout court </span></i><span id="en22623">? Please don't think it too familiar....  </span><span id="en22625">Here, on the sofa." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22629">Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. " </span><span id="en22630">In our domain," the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase  </span><i><span id="en22631">tout court </span></i><span id="en22633">, were all characteristic signs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22637">"He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one—he drew it back in time," struck him suspiciously.  </span><span id="en22639">Both were watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22642">"I brought you this paper...  </span><span id="en22644">about the watch.  </span><span id="en22646">Here it is.  </span><span id="en22648">Is it all right or shall I copy it again?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22651">"What?  </span><span id="en22653">A paper?  </span><span id="en22655">Yes, yes, don't be uneasy, it's all right," Porfiry Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the paper and looked at it. " </span><span id="en22657">Yes, it's all right.  </span><span id="en22659">Nothing more is needed," he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22662">A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the table and put it on his bureau. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22665">"I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...  </span><span id="en22667">formally...  </span><span id="en22669">about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?"  </span><span id="en22671">Raskolnikov was beginning again. " </span><span id="en22673">Why did I put in 'I believe'" passed through his mind in a flash. " </span><span id="en22674">Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ' </span><i><span id="en22675">I believe </span></i><span id="en22677">'?"  </span><span id="en22679">came in a second flash.  </span><span id="en22681">And he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that this was fearfully dangerous.  </span><span id="en22683">His nerves were quivering, his emotion was increasing. " </span><span id="en22685">It's bad, it's bad!  </span><span id="en22687">I shall say too much again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22691">"Yes, yes, yes!  </span><span id="en22693">There's no hurry, there's no hurry," muttered Porfiry Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim, as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table, at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov's suspicious glance, then again standing still and looking him straight in the face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22696">His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22699">"We've plenty of time.  </span><span id="en22701">Do you smoke?  </span><span id="en22703">have you your own?  </span><span id="en22705">Here, a cigarette!"  </span><span id="en22707">he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. " </span><span id="en22709">You know I am receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my government quarters.  </span><span id="en22711">But I am living outside for the time, I had to have some repairs done here.  </span><span id="en22713">It's almost finished now....  </span><span id="en22715">Government quarters, you know, are a capital thing.  </span><span id="en22717">Eh, what do you think?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22720">"Yes, a capital thing," answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost ironically. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22723">"A capital thing, a capital thing," repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as though he had just thought of something quite different. " </span><span id="en22725">Yes, a capital thing," he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two steps from him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22728">This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22731">But this stirred Raskolnikov's spleen more than ever and he could not resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22734">"Tell me, please," he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. " </span><span id="en22736">I believe it's a sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition—for all investigating lawyers—to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question.  </span><span id="en22738">Isn't that so?  </span><span id="en22740">It's a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals of the art?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22743">"Yes, yes....  </span><span id="en22745">Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government quarters...  </span><span id="en22747">eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22750">And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked; a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face.  </span><span id="en22752">The wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face.  </span><span id="en22754">The latter forced himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing, broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov's repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intentionally prolonged laughter lasted.  </span><span id="en22756">There was lack of precaution on both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in his visitor's face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it.  </span><span id="en22758">The latter fact was very significant in Raskolnikov's eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in another moment would break upon him... </span></p>
<p><span id="en22761">He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his cap. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22764">"Porfiry Petrovitch," he began resolutely, though with considerable irritation, "yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you for some inquiries" (he laid special stress on the word "inquiries"). " </span><span id="en22766">I have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow me to withdraw.  </span><span id="en22768">I have no time to spare....  </span><span id="en22770">I have to be at the funeral of that man who was run over, of whom you...  </span><span id="en22772">know also," he added, feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at his anger. " </span><span id="en22774">I am sick of it all, do you hear?  </span><span id="en22776">and have long been.  </span><span id="en22778">It's partly what made me ill.  </span><span id="en22780">In short," he shouted, feeling that the phrase about his illness was still more out of place, "in short, kindly examine me or let me go, at once.  </span><span id="en22782">And if you must examine me, do so in the proper form!  </span><span id="en22784">I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile, good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22787">"Good heavens!  </span><span id="en22789">What do you mean?  </span><span id="en22791">What shall I question you about?"  </span><span id="en22793">cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off laughing. " </span><span id="en22795">Please don't disturb yourself," he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. " </span><span id="en22797">There's no hurry, there's no hurry, it's all nonsense.  </span><span id="en22799">Oh, no, I'm very glad you've come to see me at last...  </span><span id="en22801">I look upon you simply as a visitor.  </span><span id="en22803">And as for my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en22805">Rodion Romanovitch?  </span><span id="en22807">That is your name?...  </span><span id="en22809">It's my nerves, you tickled me so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time....  </span><span id="en22811">I'm often afraid of an attack of paralysis.  </span><span id="en22813">Do sit down.  </span><span id="en22815">Please do, or I shall think you are angry..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22818">Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning angrily.  </span><span id="en22820">He did sit down, but still held his cap. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22823">"I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch," Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding his visitor's eyes. " </span><span id="en22825">You see, I'm a bachelor, a man of no consequence and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I'm set, I'm running to seed and...  </span><span id="en22827">and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for conversation—they are dumb, they sit opposite each other and feel awkward.  </span><span id="en22829">Everyone has subjects of conversation, ladies for instance...  </span><span id="en22830">people in high society always have their subjects of conversation,  </span><i><span id="en22831">c'est de rigueur </span></i><span id="en22833">, but people of the middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied and awkward.  </span><span id="en22835">What is the reason of it?  </span><span id="en22837">Whether it is the lack of public interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don't want to deceive one another, I don't know.  </span><span id="en22839">What do you think?  </span><span id="en22841">Do put down your cap, it looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable...  </span><span id="en22843">I am so delighted..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22847">Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry Petrovitch. " </span><span id="en22849">Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly babble?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22852">"I can't offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a friend?"  </span><span id="en22854">Porfiry pattered on, "and you know all these official duties...  </span><span id="en22856">please don't mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is absolutely indispensable for me.  </span><span id="en22858">I'm always sitting and so glad to be moving about for five minutes...  </span><span id="en22860">I suffer from my sedentary life...  </span><span id="en22862">I always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks, even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have it, modern science...  </span><span id="en22864">yes, yes....  </span><span id="en22866">But as for my duties here, inquiries and all such formalities...  </span><span id="en22868">you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...  </span><span id="en22870">I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated....  </span><span id="en22872">You made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily."  </span><span id="en22874">(Raskolnikov had made no observation of the kind. </span><span id="en22876">) "One gets into a muddle!  </span><span id="en22878">A regular muddle!  </span><span id="en22880">One keeps harping on the same note, like a drum!  </span><span id="en22882">There is to be a reform and we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he!  </span><span id="en22884">And as for our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree with you.  </span><span id="en22886">Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he! </span><span id="en22888">—your felicitous comparison, he-he!  </span><span id="en22890">So you really imagined that I meant by 'government quarters'...  </span><span id="en22892">he-he!  </span><span id="en22894">You are an ironical person.  </span><span id="en22896">Come.  </span><span id="en22898">I won't go on!  </span><span id="en22900">Ah, by the way, yes!  </span><span id="en22902">One word leads to another.  </span><span id="en22904">You spoke of formality just now, apropos of the inquiry, you know.  </span><span id="en22906">But what's the use of formality?  </span><span id="en22908">In many cases it's nonsense.  </span><span id="en22910">Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets a good deal more out of it.  </span><span id="en22912">One can always fall back on formality, allow me to assure you.  </span><span id="en22914">And after all, what does it amount to?  </span><span id="en22916">An examining lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step.  </span><span id="en22918">The work of investigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22921">Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment.  </span><span id="en22923">He had simply babbled on uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence.  </span><span id="en22925">He was almost running about the room, moving his fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his right hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words.  </span><span id="en22927">Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the door, as though he were listening. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22930">"Is he expecting anything?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22933">"You are certainly quite right about it," Porfiry began gaily, looking with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and instantly put him on his guard); "certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our legal forms, he-he!  </span><span id="en22935">Some of these elaborate psychological methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres too closely to the forms.  </span><span id="en22937">Yes...  </span><span id="en22939">I am talking of forms again.  </span><span id="en22941">Well, if I recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case entrusted to me...  </span><span id="en22943">you're reading for the law, of course, Rodion Romanovitch?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22946">"Yes, I was..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en22949">"Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future—though don't suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime!  </span><span id="en22951">No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him prematurely, even though I had evidence against him?  </span><span id="en22953">In one case I may be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn't I let him walk about the town a bit?  </span><span id="en22955">he-he-he!  </span><span id="en22957">But I see you don't quite understand, so I'll give you a clearer example.  </span><span id="en22959">If I put him in prison too soon, I may very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he!  </span><span id="en22961">You're laughing?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en22964">Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing.  </span><span id="en22966">He was sitting with compressed lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch's. </span></p>
<p><span id="en22969">"Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so different.  </span><span id="en22971">You say 'evidence'.  </span><span id="en22973">Well, there may be evidence.  </span><span id="en22975">But evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways.  </span><span id="en22977">I am an examining lawyer and a weak man, I confess it.  </span><span id="en22979">I should like to make a proof, so to say, mathematically clear.  </span><span id="en22981">I should like to make a chain of evidence such as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!  </span><span id="en22982">And if I shut him up too soon—even though I might be convinced  </span><i><span id="en22983">he </span></i><span id="en22984">  </span><span id="en22985">was the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of getting further evidence against him.  </span><span id="en22987">And how?  </span><span id="en22989">By giving him, so to speak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell.  </span><span id="en22991">They say that at Sevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once.  </span><span id="en22993">But when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted, I am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at least.  </span><span id="en22995">You're laughing, you don't believe me again?  </span><span id="en22997">Of course, you're right, too.  </span><span id="en22999">You're right, you're right.  </span><span id="en23001">These are special cases, I admit.  </span><span id="en23003">But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended, for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that's gone before.  </span><span id="en23005">Very comic cases of that sort sometimes occur.  </span><span id="en23007">If I leave one man quite alone, if I don't touch him and don't worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and if he is in continual suspicion and terror, he'll be bound to lose his head.  </span><span id="en23009">He'll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as plain as twice two are four—it's delightful.  </span><span id="en23011">It may be so with a simple peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side, it's a dead certainty.  </span><span id="en23013">For, my dear fellow, it's a very important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated.  </span><span id="en23015">And then there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them!  </span><span id="en23017">Why, they are all sick, nervous and irritable!...  </span><span id="en23019">And then how they all suffer from spleen!  </span><span id="en23021">That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us.  </span><span id="en23023">And it's no anxiety to me, his running about the town free!  </span><span id="en23025">Let him, let him walk about for a bit!  </span><span id="en23027">I know well enough that I've caught him and that he won't escape me.  </span><span id="en23029">Where could he escape to, he-he?  </span><span id="en23031">Abroad, perhaps?  </span><span id="en23033">A Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching and have taken measures.  </span><span id="en23035">Will he escape into the depths of the country perhaps?  </span><span id="en23037">But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.  </span><span id="en23039">A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants.  </span><span id="en23041">He-he!  </span><span id="en23043">But that's all nonsense, and on the surface.  </span><span id="en23044">It's not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is  </span><i><span id="en23045">psychologically </span></i><span id="en23046">  </span><span id="en23047">unable to escape me, he-he!  </span><span id="en23049">What an expression!  </span><span id="en23051">Through a law of nature he can't escape me if he had anywhere to go.  </span><span id="en23053">Have you seen a butterfly round a candle?  </span><span id="en23055">That's how he will keep circling and circling round me.  </span><span id="en23057">Freedom will lose its attractions.  </span><span id="en23059">He'll begin to brood, he'll weave a tangle round himself, he'll worry himself to death!  </span><span id="en23061">What's more he will provide me with a mathematical proof—if I only give him long enough interval....  </span><span id="en23063">And he'll keep circling round me, getting nearer and nearer and then—flop!  </span><span id="en23065">He'll fly straight into my mouth and I'll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he!  </span><span id="en23067">You don't believe me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23072">Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with the same intensity into Porfiry's face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23075">"It's a lesson," he thought, turning cold. " </span><span id="en23077">This is beyond the cat playing with a mouse, like yesterday.  </span><span id="en23079">He can't be showing off his power with no motive...  </span><span id="en23081">prompting me; he is far too clever for that...  </span><span id="en23083">he must have another object.  </span><span id="en23085">What is it?  </span><span id="en23087">It's all nonsense, my friend, you are pretending, to scare me!  </span><span id="en23089">You've no proofs and the man I saw had no real existence.  </span><span id="en23091">You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up beforehand and so to crush me.  </span><span id="en23093">But you are wrong, you won't do it!  </span><span id="en23095">But why give me such a hint?  </span><span id="en23097">Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves?  </span><span id="en23099">No, my friend, you are wrong, you won't do it even though you have some trap for me...  </span><span id="en23101">let us see what you have in store for me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23104">And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal.  </span><span id="en23106">At times he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him.  </span><span id="en23108">This anger was what he dreaded from the beginning.  </span><span id="en23110">He felt that his parched lips were flecked with foam, his heart was throbbing.  </span><span id="en23112">But he was still determined not to speak till the right moment.  </span><span id="en23114">He realised that this was the best policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too freely.  </span><span id="en23116">Anyhow, this was what he hoped for. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23119">"No, I see you don't believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke on you," Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room. " </span><span id="en23121">And to be sure you're right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like all young people.  </span><span id="en23122">Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that's for all the world like the old Austrian  </span><i><span id="en23123">Hof-kriegsrath </span></i><span id="en23125">, as far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they'd beaten Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered with all his army, he-he-he!  </span><span id="en23127">I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are laughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!  </span><span id="en23129">But I can't help it, it's my weakness.  </span><span id="en23131">I am fond of military science.  </span><span id="en23133">And I'm ever so fond of reading all military histories.  </span><span id="en23135">I've certainly missed my proper career.  </span><span id="en23137">I ought to have been in the army, upon my word I ought.  </span><span id="en23139">I shouldn't have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a major, he-he!  </span><span id="en23140">Well, I'll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about this  </span><i><span id="en23141">special case </span></i><span id="en23143">, I mean: actual fact and a man's temperament, my dear sir, are weighty matters and it's astonishing how they sometimes deceive the sharpest calculation!  </span><span id="en23145">I—listen to an old man—am speaking seriously, Rodion Romanovitch" (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) "Moreover, I'm a candid man...  </span><span id="en23147">am I a candid man or not?  </span><span id="en23149">What do you say?  </span><span id="en23151">I fancy I really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don't even expect a reward for it, he-he!  </span><span id="en23153">Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it can play!  </span><span id="en23155">So that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he's liable to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after all!  </span><span id="en23157">But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal's temperament, worse luck for him!  </span><span id="en23159">But young people carried away by their own wit don't think of that 'when they overstep all obstacles,' as you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday.  </span><span id="en23160">He will lie—that is, the man who is a  </span><i><span id="en23161">special case </span></i><span id="en23163">, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion; you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint.  </span><span id="en23165">Of course there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway!  </span><span id="en23167">Anyway he's given us the idea!  </span><span id="en23169">He lied incomparably, but he didn't reckon on his temperament.  </span><span id="en23171">That's what betrays him!  </span><span id="en23172">Another time he will be carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will be  </span><i><span id="en23173">too natural </span></i><span id="en23175">, too much like the real thing, again he has given us an idea!  </span><span id="en23177">Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like that at every step!  </span><span id="en23179">He puts himself forward where he is not wanted, speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of allegorical allusions, he-he!  </span><span id="en23181">Comes and asks why didn't you take me long ago?  </span><span id="en23183">he-he-he!  </span><span id="en23185">And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man, the psychologist, the literary man.  </span><span id="en23187">The temperament reflects everything like a mirror!  </span><span id="en23189">Gaze into it and admire what you see!  </span><span id="en23191">But why are you so pale, Rodion Romanovitch?  </span><span id="en23193">Is the room stuffy?  </span><span id="en23195">Shall I open the window?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23202">"Oh, don't trouble, please," cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke into a laugh. " </span><span id="en23204">Please don't trouble." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23207">Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.  </span><span id="en23209">Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical laughter. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23212">"Porfiry Petrovitch," he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. " </span><span id="en23214">I see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister Lizaveta.  </span><span id="en23216">Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this.  </span><span id="en23218">If you find that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then prosecute me, arrest me.  </span><span id="en23220">But I will not let myself be jeered at to my face and worried..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23223">His lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain his voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23226">"I won't allow it!"  </span><span id="en23228">he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. " </span><span id="en23230">Do you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch?  </span><span id="en23232">I won't allow it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23235">"Good heavens!  </span><span id="en23237">What does it mean?"  </span><span id="en23239">cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently quite frightened. " </span><span id="en23241">Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the matter with you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23244">"I won't allow it," Raskolnikov shouted again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23247">"Hush, my dear man!  </span><span id="en23249">They'll hear and come in.  </span><span id="en23251">Just think, what could we say to them?"  </span><span id="en23253">Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face close to Raskolnikov's. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23256">"I won't allow it, I won't allow it," Raskolnikov repeated mechanically, but he too spoke in a sudden whisper. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23259">Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23262">"Some fresh air!  </span><span id="en23264">And you must have some water, my dear fellow.  </span><span id="en23266">You're ill!"  </span><span id="en23268">and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a decanter of water in the corner. " </span><span id="en23270">Come, drink a little," he whispered, rushing up to him with the decanter. " </span><span id="en23272">It will be sure to do you good." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23275">Porfiry Petrovitch's alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity.  </span><span id="en23277">He did not take the water, however. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23280">"Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you'll drive yourself out of your mind, I assure you, ach, ach!  </span><span id="en23282">Have some water, do drink a little." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23285">He forced him to take the glass.  </span><span id="en23287">Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to his lips, but set it on the table again with disgust. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23290">"Yes, you've had a little attack!  </span><span id="en23292">You'll bring back your illness again, my dear fellow," Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy, though he still looked rather disconcerted. " </span><span id="en23294">Good heavens, you must take more care of yourself!  </span><span id="en23296">Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me yesterday—I know, I know, I've a nasty, ironical temper, but what they made of it!...  </span><span id="en23298">Good heavens, he came yesterday after you'd been.  </span><span id="en23300">We dined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands in despair!  </span><span id="en23302">Did he come from you?  </span><span id="en23304">But do sit down, for mercy's sake, sit down!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23307">"No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went," Raskolnikov answered sharply. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23310">"You knew?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23313">"I knew.  </span><span id="en23315">What of it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23318">"Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you; I know about everything.  </span><span id="en23319">I know how you went  </span><i><span id="en23320">to take a flat </span></i><span id="en23321">  </span><span id="en23322">at night when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it.  </span><span id="en23324">Yes, I understand your state of mind at that time...  </span><span id="en23326">but you'll drive yourself mad like that, upon my word!  </span><span id="en23328">You'll lose your head!  </span><span id="en23330">You're full of generous indignation at the wrongs you've received, first from destiny, and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness.  </span><span id="en23332">That's so, isn't it?  </span><span id="en23334">I have guessed how you feel, haven't I?  </span><span id="en23335">Only in that way you'll lose your head and Razumihin's, too; he's too  </span><i><span id="en23336">good </span></i><span id="en23337">  </span><span id="en23338">a man for such a position, you must know that.  </span><span id="en23340">You are ill and he is good and your illness is infectious for him...  </span><span id="en23342">I'll tell you about it when you are more yourself....  </span><span id="en23344">But do sit down, for goodness' sake.  </span><span id="en23346">Please rest, you look shocking, do sit down." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23351">Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over.  </span><span id="en23353">In amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.  </span><span id="en23355">But he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange inclination to believe.  </span><span id="en23357">Porfiry's unexpected words about the flat had utterly overwhelmed him. " </span><span id="en23359">How can it be, he knows about the flat then," he thought suddenly, "and he tells it me himself!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23362">"Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a case of morbid psychology," Porfiry went on quickly. " </span><span id="en23364">A man confessed to murder and how he kept it up!  </span><span id="en23366">It was a regular hallucination; he brought forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why?  </span><span id="en23368">He had been partly, but only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he persuaded himself that he was the murderer.  </span><span id="en23370">But at last the High Court of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under proper care.  </span><span id="en23372">Thanks to the Court of Appeal!  </span><span id="en23374">Tut-tut-tut!  </span><span id="en23376">Why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood!  </span><span id="en23378">I've studied all this morbid psychology in my practice.  </span><span id="en23380">A man is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry.  </span><span id="en23382">Just the same with bell-ringing....  </span><span id="en23384">It's all illness, Rodion Romanovitch!  </span><span id="en23386">You have begun to neglect your illness.  </span><span id="en23388">You should consult an experienced doctor, what's the good of that fat fellow?  </span><span id="en23390">You are lightheaded!  </span><span id="en23392">You were delirious when you did all this!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23395">For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23398">"Is it possible, is it possible," flashed through his mind, "that he is still lying?  </span><span id="en23400">He can't be, he can't be."  </span><span id="en23402">He rejected that idea, feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury might drive him mad. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23405">"I was not delirious.  </span><span id="en23407">I knew what I was doing," he cried, straining every faculty to penetrate Porfiry's game, "I was quite myself, do you hear?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23410">"Yes, I hear and understand.  </span><span id="en23412">You said yesterday you were not delirious, you were particularly emphatic about it!  </span><span id="en23414">I understand all you can tell me!  </span><span id="en23416">A-ach!...  </span><span id="en23418">Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow.  </span><span id="en23420">If you were actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business, would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession of your faculties?  </span><span id="en23422">And so emphatically and persistently?  </span><span id="en23424">Would it be possible?  </span><span id="en23426">Quite impossible, to my thinking.  </span><span id="en23428">If you had anything on your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.  </span><span id="en23430">That's so, isn't it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23433">There was a note of slyness in this inquiry.  </span><span id="en23435">Raskolnikov drew back on the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23438">"Another thing about Razumihin—you certainly ought to have said that he came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it!  </span><span id="en23440">But you don't conceal it!  </span><span id="en23442">You lay stress on his coming at your instigation." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23445">Raskolnikov had not done so.  </span><span id="en23447">A chill went down his back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23450">"You keep telling lies," he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips into a sickly smile, "you are trying again to show that you know all my game, that you know all I shall say beforehand," he said, conscious himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. " </span><span id="en23452">You want to frighten me...  </span><span id="en23454">or you are simply laughing at me..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23457">He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of intense hatred in his eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23460">"You keep lying," he said. " </span><span id="en23462">You know perfectly well that the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible...  </span><span id="en23464">to conceal as little as possible.  </span><span id="en23466">I don't believe you!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23469">"What a wily person you are!"  </span><span id="en23471">Porfiry tittered, "there's no catching you; you've a perfect monomania.  </span><span id="en23473">So you don't believe me?  </span><span id="en23475">But still you do believe me, you believe a quarter; I'll soon make you believe the whole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you good." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23478">Raskolnikov's lips trembled. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23481">"Yes, I do," went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov's arm genially, "you must take care of your illness.  </span><span id="en23483">Besides, your mother and sister are here now; you must think of them.  </span><span id="en23485">You must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but frighten them..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23488">"What has that to do with you?  </span><span id="en23490">How do you know it?  </span><span id="en23492">What concern is it of yours?  </span><span id="en23494">You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23497">"Good heavens!  </span><span id="en23499">Why, I learnt it all from you yourself!  </span><span id="en23501">You don't notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything.  </span><span id="en23503">From Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday.  </span><span id="en23505">No, you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things.  </span><span id="en23507">To return to bell-ringing, for instance.  </span><span id="en23509">I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having), and you see nothing in it!  </span><span id="en23511">Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you, should I have acted like that?  </span><span id="en23513">No, I should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your expression) saying: 'And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman's flat and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood?  </span><span id="en23515">And why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant? </span><span id="en23517">' That's how I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you.  </span><span id="en23519">I ought to have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps have arrested you, too...  </span><span id="en23521">so I have no suspicion of you, since I have not done that!  </span><span id="en23523">But you can't look at it normally and you see nothing, I say again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23526">Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to perceive it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23529">"You are lying all the while," he cried, "I don't know your object, but you are lying.  </span><span id="en23531">You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be mistaken!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23534">"I am lying?"  </span><span id="en23536">Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least concerned at Raskolnikov's opinion of him. " </span><span id="en23538">I am lying...  </span><span id="en23540">but how did I treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer?  </span><span id="en23542">Prompting you and giving you every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury, melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it?  </span><span id="en23544">Ah!  </span><span id="en23546">He-he-he!  </span><span id="en23548">Though, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very reliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don't remember—that's all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others?  </span><span id="en23550">There may have been others, eh?  </span><span id="en23552">He-he-he!" </span></p>
<a id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@2554@2554-h@2554-h-13_htm_html"></a><p><span id="en23555">Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23558">"Briefly," he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so doing pushing Porfiry back a little, "briefly, I want to know, do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not?  </span><span id="en23560">Tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23563">"What a business I'm having with you!"  </span><span id="en23565">cried Porfiry with a perfectly good-humoured, sly and composed face. " </span><span id="en23567">And why do you want to know, why do you want to know so much, since they haven't begun to worry you?  </span><span id="en23569">Why, you are like a child asking for matches!  </span><span id="en23571">And why are you so uneasy?  </span><span id="en23573">Why do you force yourself upon us, eh?  </span><span id="en23575">He-he-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23578">"I repeat," Raskolnikov cried furiously, "that I can't put up with it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23581">"With what?  </span><span id="en23583">Uncertainty?"  </span><span id="en23585">interrupted Porfiry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23588">"Don't jeer at me!  </span><span id="en23590">I won't have it!  </span><span id="en23592">I tell you I won't have it.  </span><span id="en23594">I can't and I won't, do you hear, do you hear?"  </span><span id="en23596">he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23599">"Hush!  </span><span id="en23601">Hush!  </span><span id="en23603">They'll overhear!  </span><span id="en23605">I warn you seriously, take care of yourself.  </span><span id="en23607">I am not joking," Porfiry whispered, but this time there was not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face.  </span><span id="en23609">Now he was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all mystification. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23612">But this was only for an instant.  </span><span id="en23614">Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to speak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23617">"I will not allow myself to be tortured," he whispered, instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the thought. " </span><span id="en23619">Arrest me, search me, but kindly act in due form and don't play with me!  </span><span id="en23621">Don't dare!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23624">"Don't worry about the form," Porfiry interrupted with the same sly smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en23626">I invited you to see me quite in a friendly way." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23629">"I don't want your friendship and I spit on it!  </span><span id="en23631">Do you hear?  </span><span id="en23633">And, here, I take my cap and go.  </span><span id="en23635">What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23638">He took up his cap and went to the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23641">"And won't you see my little surprise?"  </span><span id="en23643">chuckled Porfiry, again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23646">He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23649">"What surprise?"  </span><span id="en23651">he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in alarm. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23654">"My little surprise, it's sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!"  </span><span id="en23656">(He pointed to the locked door. </span><span id="en23658">) "I locked him in that he should not escape." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23661">"What is it?  </span><span id="en23663">Where?  </span><span id="en23665">What?..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23668">Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was locked. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23671">"It's locked, here is the key!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23674">And he brought a key out of his pocket. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23677">"You are lying," roared Raskolnikov without restraint, "you lie, you damned punchinello!"  </span><span id="en23679">and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other door, not at all alarmed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23682">"I understand it all!  </span><span id="en23684">You are lying and mocking so that I may betray myself to you..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23687">"Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en23689">You are in a passion.  </span><span id="en23691">Don't shout, I shall call the clerks." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23694">"You are lying!  </span><span id="en23696">Call the clerks!  </span><span id="en23698">You knew I was ill and tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object!  </span><span id="en23700">Produce your facts!  </span><span id="en23702">I understand it all.  </span><span id="en23704">You've no evidence, you have only wretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov's!  </span><span id="en23706">You knew my character, you wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and deputies....  </span><span id="en23708">Are you waiting for them?  </span><span id="en23710">eh!  </span><span id="en23712">What are you waiting for?  </span><span id="en23714">Where are they?  </span><span id="en23716">Produce them?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23719">"Why deputies, my good man?  </span><span id="en23721">What things people will imagine!  </span><span id="en23723">And to do so would not be acting in form as you say, you don't know the business, my dear fellow....  </span><span id="en23725">And there's no escaping form, as you see," Porfiry muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23728">"Ah, they're coming," cried Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en23730">You've sent for them!  </span><span id="en23732">You expected them!  </span><span id="en23734">Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses, what you like!...  </span><span id="en23736">I am ready!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23739">But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their interview. </span></p>

<p><span id="en23743">When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23746">The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a little. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23749">"What is it?"  </span><span id="en23751">cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. " </span><span id="en23753">Why, I gave orders..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23756">For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing somebody back. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23759">"What is it?"  </span><span id="en23761">Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23764">"The prisoner Nikolay has been brought," someone answered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23767">"He is not wanted!  </span><span id="en23769">Take him away!  </span><span id="en23771">Let him wait!  </span><span id="en23773">What's he doing here?  </span><span id="en23775">How irregular!"  </span><span id="en23777">cried Porfiry, rushing to the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23780">"But he..."  </span><span id="en23782">began the same voice, and suddenly ceased. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23785">Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23788">This man's appearance was at first sight very strange.  </span><span id="en23790">He stared straight before him, as though seeing nothing.  </span><span id="en23792">There was a determined gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his face, as though he were being led to the scaffold.  </span><span id="en23794">His white lips were faintly twitching. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23797">He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young, slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features.  </span><span id="en23799">The man whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23802">Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway.  </span><span id="en23804">Some of them tried to get in.  </span><span id="en23806">All this took place almost instantaneously. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23809">"Go away, it's too soon!  </span><span id="en23811">Wait till you are sent for!...  </span><span id="en23813">Why have you brought him so soon?"  </span><span id="en23815">Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed, and as it were thrown out of his reckoning. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23818">But Nikolay suddenly knelt down. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23821">"What's the matter?"  </span><span id="en23823">cried Porfiry, surprised. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23826">"I am guilty!  </span><span id="en23828">Mine is the sin!  </span><span id="en23830">I am the murderer," Nikolay articulated suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23833">For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb; even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and stood immovable. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23836">"What is it?"  </span><span id="en23838">cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary stupefaction. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23841">"I...  </span><span id="en23843">am the murderer," repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23846">"What...  </span><span id="en23848">you...  </span><span id="en23850">what...  </span><span id="en23852">whom did you kill?"  </span><span id="en23854">Porfiry Petrovitch was obviously bewildered. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23857">Nikolay again was silent for a moment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23860">"Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I...  </span><span id="en23862">killed...  </span><span id="en23864">with an axe.  </span><span id="en23866">Darkness came over me," he added suddenly, and was again silent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23869">He still remained on his knees.  </span><span id="en23871">Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators.  </span><span id="en23873">They instantly vanished and closed the door.  </span><span id="en23875">Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short, looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23878">"You're in too great a hurry," he shouted at him, almost angrily. " </span><span id="en23880">I didn't ask you what came over you....  </span><span id="en23882">Speak, did you kill them?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23885">"I am the murderer....  </span><span id="en23887">I want to give evidence," Nikolay pronounced. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23890">"Ach!  </span><span id="en23892">What did you kill them with?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23895">"An axe.  </span><span id="en23897">I had it ready." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23900">"Ach, he is in a hurry!  </span><span id="en23902">Alone?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23905">Nikolay did not understand the question. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23908">"Did you do it alone?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23911">"Yes, alone.  </span><span id="en23913">And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23916">"Don't be in a hurry about Mitka!  </span><span id="en23918">A-ach!  </span><span id="en23920">How was it you ran downstairs like that at the time?  </span><span id="en23922">The porters met you both!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23925">"It was to put them off the scent...  </span><span id="en23927">I ran after Mitka," Nikolay replied hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23930">"I knew it!"  </span><span id="en23932">cried Porfiry, with vexation. " </span><span id="en23934">It's not his own tale he is telling," he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested on Raskolnikov again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23937">He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had forgotten Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en23939">He was a little taken aback. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23942">"My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!"  </span><span id="en23944">he flew up to him, "this won't do; I'm afraid you must go...  </span><span id="en23946">it's no good your staying...  </span><span id="en23948">I will...  </span><span id="en23950">you see, what a surprise!...  </span><span id="en23952">Good-bye!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23955">And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23958">"I suppose you didn't expect it?"  </span><span id="en23960">said Raskolnikov who, though he had not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23963">"You did not expect it either, my friend.  </span><span id="en23965">See how your hand is trembling!  </span><span id="en23967">He-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23970">"You're trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23973">"Yes, I am; I didn't expect it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en23976">They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to be gone. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23979">"And your little surprise, aren't you going to show it to me?"  </span><span id="en23981">Raskolnikov said, sarcastically. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23984">"Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he!  </span><span id="en23986">You are an ironical person!  </span><span id="en23988">Come, till we meet!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23990">"I believe we can say  </span><i><span id="en23991">good-bye </span></i><span id="en23992">!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en23995">"That's in God's hands," muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en23998">As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people were looking at him.  </span><span id="en23999">Among them he saw the two porters from  </span><i><span id="en24000">the </span></i><span id="en24001">  </span><span id="en24002">house, whom he had invited that night to the police station.  </span><span id="en24004">They stood there waiting.  </span><span id="en24006">But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of Porfiry Petrovitch behind him.  </span><span id="en24008">Turning round, he saw the latter running after him, out of breath. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24012">"One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it's in God's hands, but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask you...  </span><span id="en24014">so we shall meet again, shan't we?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24017">And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24020">"Shan't we?"  </span><span id="en24022">he added again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24025">He seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24028">"You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed...  </span><span id="en24030">I lost my temper," began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24033">"Don't mention it, don't mention it," Porfiry replied, almost gleefully. " </span><span id="en24035">I myself, too...  </span><span id="en24037">I have a wicked temper, I admit it!  </span><span id="en24039">But we shall meet again.  </span><span id="en24041">If it's God's will, we may see a great deal of one another." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24044">"And will get to know each other through and through?"  </span><span id="en24046">added Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24049">"Yes; know each other through and through," assented Porfiry Petrovitch, and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en24051">Now you're going to a birthday party?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24054">"To a funeral." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24057">"Of course, the funeral!  </span><span id="en24059">Take care of yourself, and get well." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24062">"I don't know what to wish you," said Raskolnikov, who had begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again. " </span><span id="en24064">I should like to wish you success, but your office is such a comical one." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24067">"Why comical?"  </span><span id="en24069">Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to prick up his ears at this. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24072">"Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed!  </span><span id="en24074">You must have been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and now that he has confessed, you'll begin vivisecting him again.  </span><span id="en24076">'You are lying,' you'll say.  </span><span id="en24078">'You are not the murderer!  </span><span id="en24080">You can't be!  </span><span id="en24082">It's not your own tale you are telling! </span><span id="en24084">' You must admit it's a comical business!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24087">"He-he-he!  </span><span id="en24089">You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was not his own tale he was telling?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24092">"How could I help noticing it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24095">"He-he!  </span><span id="en24097">You are quick-witted.  </span><span id="en24099">You notice everything!  </span><span id="en24101">You've really a playful mind!  </span><span id="en24103">And you always fasten on the comic side...  </span><span id="en24105">he-he!  </span><span id="en24107">They say that was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24110">"Yes, of Gogol." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24113">"Yes, of Gogol....  </span><span id="en24115">I shall look forward to meeting you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24118">"So shall I." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24121">Raskolnikov walked straight home.  </span><span id="en24123">He was so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to collect his thoughts.  </span><span id="en24125">He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable, amazing—something beyond his understanding.  </span><span id="en24127">But Nikolay's confession was an actual fact.  </span><span id="en24129">The consequences of this fact were clear to him at once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they would be after him again.  </span><span id="en24131">Till then, at least, he was free and must do something for himself, for the danger was imminent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24134">But how imminent?  </span><span id="en24136">His position gradually became clear to him.  </span><span id="en24138">Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with Porfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror.  </span><span id="en24140">Of course, he did not yet know all Porfiry's aims, he could not see into all his calculations.  </span><span id="en24142">But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry's "lead" had been for him.  </span><span id="en24143">A little more and he  </span><i><span id="en24144">might </span></i><span id="en24145">  </span><span id="en24146">have given himself away completely, circumstantially.  </span><span id="en24148">Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was bound to win.  </span><span id="en24149">There's no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised himself seriously, but no  </span><i><span id="en24150">facts </span></i><span id="en24151">  </span><span id="en24152">had come to light as yet; there was nothing positive.  </span><span id="en24154">But was he taking a true view of the position?  </span><span id="en24156">Wasn't he mistaken?  </span><span id="en24158">What had Porfiry been trying to get at?  </span><span id="en24160">Had he really some surprise prepared for him?  </span><span id="en24162">And what was it?  </span><span id="en24164">Had he really been expecting something or not?  </span><span id="en24166">How would they have parted if it had not been for the unexpected appearance of Nikolay? </span></p>
<p><span id="en24171">Porfiry had shown almost all his cards—of course, he had risked something in showing them—and if he had really had anything up his sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too.  </span><span id="en24173">What was that "surprise"?  </span><span id="en24175">Was it a joke?  </span><span id="en24177">Had it meant anything?  </span><span id="en24179">Could it have concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence?  </span><span id="en24181">His yesterday's visitor?  </span><span id="en24183">What had become of him?  </span><span id="en24185">Where was he to-day?  </span><span id="en24187">If Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en24190">He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in his hands.  </span><span id="en24192">He was still shivering nervously.  </span><span id="en24194">At last he got up, took his cap, thought a minute, and went to the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24197">He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might consider himself out of danger.  </span><span id="en24199">He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna's.  </span><span id="en24201">He would be too late for the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner, and there at once he would see Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24204">He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his lips. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24207">"To-day!  </span><span id="en24209">To-day," he repeated to himself. " </span><span id="en24211">Yes, to-day!  </span><span id="en24213">So it must be...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24216">But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself.  </span><span id="en24218">He started and moved back.  </span><span id="en24219">The door opened gently and slowly, and there suddenly appeared a figure—yesterday's visitor  </span><i><span id="en24220">from underground </span></i><span id="en24221">. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24224">The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking, and took a step forward into the room.  </span><span id="en24226">He was exactly the same as yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply.  </span><span id="en24228">If he had only put his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have looked exactly like a peasant woman. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24231">"What do you want?"  </span><span id="en24233">asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror.  </span><span id="en24235">The man was still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching it with his finger. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24238">"What is it?"  </span><span id="en24240">cried Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24243">"I have sinned," the man articulated softly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24246">"How?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24249">"By evil thoughts." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24252">They looked at one another. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24255">"I was vexed.  </span><span id="en24257">When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they let you go and took you for drunken.  </span><span id="en24259">I was so vexed that I lost my sleep.  </span><span id="en24261">And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for you...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24264">"Who came?"  </span><span id="en24266">Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24269">"I did, I've wronged you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24272">"Then you come from that house?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24275">"I was standing at the gate with them...  </span><span id="en24277">don't you remember?  </span><span id="en24279">We have carried on our trade in that house for years past.  </span><span id="en24281">We cure and prepare hides, we take work home...  </span><span id="en24283">most of all I was vexed...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24286">And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before Raskolnikov's mind; he recollected that there had been several people there besides the porters, women among them.  </span><span id="en24288">He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the police-station.  </span><span id="en24290">He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round and made him some answer.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en24293">So this was the solution of yesterday's horror.  </span><span id="en24294">The most awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself on account of such a  </span><i><span id="en24295">trivial </span></i><span id="en24296">  </span><span id="en24297">circumstance.  </span><span id="en24299">So this man could tell nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains.  </span><span id="en24300">So Porfiry, too, had nothing but that  </span><i><span id="en24301">delirium </span></i><span id="en24302">, no facts but this  </span><i><span id="en24303">psychology </span></i><span id="en24304"> which  </span><i><span id="en24305">cuts both ways </span></i><span id="en24307">, nothing positive.  </span><span id="en24309">So if no more facts come to light (and they must not, they must not! </span><span id="en24311">) then...  </span><span id="en24313">then what can they do to him?  </span><span id="en24315">How can they convict him, even if they arrest him?  </span><span id="en24317">And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24324">"Was it you who told Porfiry...  </span><span id="en24326">that I'd been there?"  </span><span id="en24328">he cried, struck by a sudden idea. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24331">"What Porfiry?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24334">"The head of the detective department?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24337">"Yes.  </span><span id="en24339">The porters did not go there, but I went." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24342">"To-day?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24345">"I got there two minutes before you.  </span><span id="en24347">And I heard, I heard it all, how he worried you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24350">"Where?  </span><span id="en24352">What?  </span><span id="en24354">When?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24357">"Why, in the next room.  </span><span id="en24359">I was sitting there all the time." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24362">"What?  </span><span id="en24364">Why, then you were the surprise?  </span><span id="en24366">But how could it happen?  </span><span id="en24368">Upon my word!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24371">"I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said," began the man; "for it's too late, said they, and maybe he'll be angry that we did not come at the time.  </span><span id="en24373">I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making inquiries.  </span><span id="en24375">And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day.  </span><span id="en24377">The first time I went he wasn't there, when I came an hour later he couldn't see me.  </span><span id="en24379">I went the third time, and they showed me in.  </span><span id="en24381">I informed him of everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room and punching himself on the chest.  </span><span id="en24383">'What do you scoundrels mean by it?  </span><span id="en24385">If I'd known about it I should have arrested him! </span><span id="en24387">' Then he ran out, called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned to me, scolding and questioning me.  </span><span id="en24389">He scolded me a great deal; and I told him everything, and I told him that you didn't dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and that you didn't recognise me.  </span><span id="en24391">And he fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told me to go into the next room.  </span><span id="en24393">'Sit there a bit,' he said.  </span><span id="en24395">'Don't move, whatever you may hear. </span><span id="en24397">' And he set a chair there for me and locked me in.  </span><span id="en24399">'Perhaps,' he said, 'I may call you. </span><span id="en24401">' And when Nikolay'd been brought he let me out as soon as you were gone.  </span><span id="en24403">'I shall send for you again and question you,' he said." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24406">"And did he question Nikolay while you were there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24409">"He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24412">The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground with his finger. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24415">"Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24418">"May God forgive you," answered Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24421">And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground, turned slowly and went out of the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24424">"It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways," repeated Raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24427">"Now we'll make a fight for it," he said, with a malicious smile, as he went down the stairs.  </span><span id="en24429">His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and contempt he recollected his "cowardice." </span></p>

<p><span id="en24434">The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en24436">Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before fantastic and incredible.  </span><span id="en24438">The black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart all night.  </span><span id="en24440">When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch immediately looked in the looking-glass.  </span><span id="en24442">He was afraid that he had jaundice.  </span><span id="en24444">However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better one.  </span><span id="en24446">But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.  </span><span id="en24448">That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his young friend's account.  </span><span id="en24450">He had set down a good many points against him of late.  </span><span id="en24452">His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday's interview.  </span><span id="en24454">That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness and irritability....  </span><span id="en24456">Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness followed another.  </span><span id="en24458">He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate.  </span><span id="en24460">He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman, would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated.  </span><span id="en24462">In the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the flat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24465">"Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?"  </span><span id="en24467">Pyotr Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a gleam of desperate hope. " </span><span id="en24469">Can all that be really so irrevocably over?  </span><span id="en24471">Is it no use to make another effort?"  </span><span id="en24473">The thought of Dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his heart.  </span><span id="en24475">He endured anguish at that moment, and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it, Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24478">"It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money," he thought, as he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov's room, "and why on earth was I such a Jew?  </span><span id="en24480">It was false economy!  </span><span id="en24482">I meant to keep them without a penny so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!  </span><span id="en24484">foo!  </span><span id="en24486">If I'd spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and all that sort of trash from Knopp's and the English shop, my position would have been better and...  </span><span id="en24488">stronger!  </span><span id="en24490">They could not have refused me so easily!  </span><span id="en24492">They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to do it!  </span><span id="en24494">And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?....  </span><span id="en24496">H'm!  </span><span id="en24498">I've made a blunder." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24501">And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a fool—but not aloud, of course. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24504">He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before.  </span><span id="en24506">The preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna's excited his curiosity as he passed.  </span><span id="en24508">He had heard about it the day before; he fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention.  </span><span id="en24510">Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch, was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most important of the lodgers.  </span><span id="en24512">Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them; she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she was proud of it.  </span><span id="en24514">All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov's, somewhat thoughtful.  </span><span id="en24516">He had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24519">Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning.  </span><span id="en24521">The attitude of Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.  </span><span id="en24523">Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him.  </span><span id="en24525">He had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object.  </span><span id="en24527">He had heard of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces.  </span><span id="en24529">It had impressed Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en24531">These powerful omniscient circles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm.  </span><span id="en24533">He had not, of course, been able to form even an approximate notion of what they meant.  </span><span id="en24535">He, like everyone, had heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree.  </span><span id="en24536">What for many years past he had feared more than anything was  </span><i><span id="en24537">being shown up </span></i><span id="en24538">  </span><span id="en24539">and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his business to Petersburg.  </span><span id="en24541">He was afraid of this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken.  </span><span id="en24543">Some years before, when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his, had been cruelly shown up.  </span><span id="en24545">One instance had ended in great scandal for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious trouble.  </span><span id="en24547">For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of "our younger generation."  </span><span id="en24549">He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current phrases.  </span><span id="en24551">He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en24553">Even if he had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it would not have allayed his uneasiness.  </span><span id="en24555">All the doctrines, the ideas, the systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him.  </span><span id="en24556">He had his own object—he simply wanted to find out at once what was happening  </span><i><span id="en24557">here </span></i><span id="en24559">. Had these people any power or not?  </span><span id="en24561">Had he anything to fear from them?  </span><span id="en24563">Would they expose any enterprise of his?  </span><span id="en24565">And what precisely was now the object of their attacks?  </span><span id="en24567">Could he somehow make up to them and get round them if they really were powerful?  </span><span id="en24569">Was this the thing to do or not?  </span><span id="en24571">Couldn't he gain something through them?  </span><span id="en24573">In fact hundreds of questions presented themselves. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24578">Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud.  </span><span id="en24580">He was a clerk and had almost always something wrong with his eyes.  </span><span id="en24582">He was rather soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.  </span><span id="en24584">He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings.  </span><span id="en24586">Andrey Semyonovitch really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress and "our younger generation" from enthusiasm.  </span><span id="en24588">He was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited, half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve, however sincerely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24591">Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to dislike Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en24593">This happened on both sides unconsciously.  </span><span id="en24595">However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that "he was not the right sort of man."  </span><span id="en24597">He had tried expounding to him the system of Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even to be rude.  </span><span id="en24599">The fact was he had begun instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle.  </span><span id="en24601">A fine person he would be to show anyone up!  </span><span id="en24603">It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance, when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to the establishment of the new "commune," or to abstain from christening his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a month after marriage, and so on.  </span><span id="en24605">Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were attributed to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24608">Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over bundles of notes.  </span><span id="en24610">Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt.  </span><span id="en24612">Nothing would have convinced Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money unmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr Petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and was, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24615">He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation of a new special "commune."  </span><span id="en24617">The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr Petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony.  </span><span id="en24619">But the "humane" Andrey Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch's ill-humour to his recent breach with Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that theme.  </span><span id="en24621">He had something progressive to say on the subject which might console his worthy friend and "could not fail" to promote his development. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24624">"There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that...  </span><span id="en24626">at the widow's, isn't there?"  </span><span id="en24628">Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24631">"Why, don't you know?  </span><span id="en24633">Why, I was telling you last night what I think about all such ceremonies.  </span><span id="en24635">And she invited you too, I heard.  </span><span id="en24637">You were talking to her yesterday..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24640">"I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en24642">I was surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the wines!  </span><span id="en24644">Several people are invited.  </span><span id="en24646">It's beyond everything!"  </span><span id="en24648">continued Pyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the conversation. " </span><span id="en24650">What?  </span><span id="en24652">You say I am asked too?  </span><span id="en24654">When was that?  </span><span id="en24656">I don't remember.  </span><span id="en24658">But I shan't go.  </span><span id="en24660">Why should I?  </span><span id="en24662">I only said a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year's salary as a destitute widow of a government clerk.  </span><span id="en24664">I suppose she has invited me on that account, hasn't she?  </span><span id="en24666">He-he-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24669">"I don't intend to go either," said Lebeziatnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24672">"I should think not, after giving her a thrashing!  </span><span id="en24674">You might well hesitate, he-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24677">"Who thrashed?  </span><span id="en24679">Whom?"  </span><span id="en24681">cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24684">"Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago.  </span><span id="en24686">I heard so yesterday...  </span><span id="en24688">so that's what your convictions amount to...  </span><span id="en24690">and the woman question, too, wasn't quite sound, he-he-he!"  </span><span id="en24692">and Pyotr Petrovitch, as though comforted, went back to clicking his beads. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24695">"It's all slander and nonsense!"  </span><span id="en24697">cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always afraid of allusions to the subject. " </span><span id="en24699">It was not like that at all, it was quite different.  </span><span id="en24701">You've heard it wrong; it's a libel.  </span><span id="en24703">I was simply defending myself.  </span><span id="en24705">She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled out all my whiskers....  </span><span id="en24707">It's permissable for anyone, I should hope, to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle, for it's an act of despotism.  </span><span id="en24709">What was I to do?  </span><span id="en24711">I simply pushed her back." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24714">"He-he-he!"  </span><span id="en24716">Luzhin went on laughing maliciously. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24719">"You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself....  </span><span id="en24721">But that's nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the woman question!  </span><span id="en24723">You don't understand; I used to think, indeed, that if women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is maintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too.  </span><span id="en24725">Of course, I reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise, for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is unthinkable...  </span><span id="en24727">and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality in fighting.  </span><span id="en24729">I am not so stupid...  </span><span id="en24731">though, of course, there is fighting...  </span><span id="en24733">there won't be later, but at present there is...  </span><span id="en24735">confound it!  </span><span id="en24737">How muddled one gets with you!  </span><span id="en24739">It's not on that account that I am not going.  </span><span id="en24741">I am not going on principle, not to take part in the revolting convention of memorial dinners, that's why!  </span><span id="en24743">Though, of course, one might go to laugh at it....  </span><span id="en24745">I am sorry there won't be any priests at it.  </span><span id="en24747">I should certainly go if there were." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24750">"Then you would sit down at another man's table and insult it and those who invited you.  </span><span id="en24752">Eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24755">"Certainly not insult, but protest.  </span><span id="en24757">I should do it with a good object.  </span><span id="en24759">I might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda.  </span><span id="en24761">It's a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly, perhaps, the better.  </span><span id="en24763">I might drop a seed, an idea....  </span><span id="en24765">And something might grow up from that seed.  </span><span id="en24767">How should I be insulting them?  </span><span id="en24769">They might be offended at first, but afterwards they'd see I'd done them a service.  </span><span id="en24771">You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed because when she left her family and...  </span><span id="en24773">devoted...  </span><span id="en24775">herself, she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn't go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh, that she might have spared them and have written more kindly.  </span><span id="en24777">I think that's all nonsense and there's no need of softness; on the contrary, what's wanted is protest.  </span><span id="en24779">Varents had been married seven years, she abandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a letter: 'I have realised that I cannot be happy with you.  </span><span id="en24781">I can never forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there is another organisation of society by means of the communities.  </span><span id="en24783">I have only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given myself and with whom I am establishing a community.  </span><span id="en24785">I speak plainly because I consider it dishonest to deceive you.  </span><span id="en24787">Do as you think best.  </span><span id="en24789">Do not hope to get me back, you are too late.  </span><span id="en24791">I hope you will be happy. </span><span id="en24793">' That's how letters like that ought to be written!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24796">"Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24799">"No, it's only the second, really!  </span><span id="en24801">But what if it were the fourth, what if it were the fifteenth, that's all nonsense!  </span><span id="en24803">And if ever I regretted the death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think if my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them!  </span><span id="en24805">I would have done something on purpose...  </span><span id="en24807">I would have shown them!  </span><span id="en24809">I would have astonished them!  </span><span id="en24811">I am really sorry there is no one!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24814">"To surprise!  </span><span id="en24816">He-he!  </span><span id="en24818">Well, be that as you will," Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted, "but tell me this; do you know the dead man's daughter, the delicate-looking little thing?  </span><span id="en24820">It's true what they say about her, isn't it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24823">"What of it?  </span><span id="en24825">I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that this is the normal condition of women.  </span><span id="en24827">Why not?  </span><span id="en24828">I mean,  </span><i><span id="en24829">distinguons </span></i><span id="en24831">. In our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is compulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal, because it will be voluntary.  </span><span id="en24833">Even as it is, she was quite right: she was suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which she had a perfect right to dispose of.  </span><span id="en24835">Of course, in the future society there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another significance, rational and in harmony with her environment.  </span><span id="en24837">As to Sofya Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice indeed when I look at her!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24841">"I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24844">Lebeziatnikov was enraged. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24847">"That's another slander," he yelled. " </span><span id="en24849">It was not so at all!  </span><span id="en24851">That was all Katerina Ivanovna's invention, for she did not understand!  </span><span id="en24853">And I never made love to Sofya Semyonovna!  </span><span id="en24855">I was simply developing her, entirely disinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest....  </span><span id="en24857">All I wanted was her protest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24860">"Have you asked her to join your community?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24863">"You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell you.  </span><span id="en24865">You don't understand!  </span><span id="en24867">There is no such rôle in a community.  </span><span id="en24869">The community is established that there should be no such rôles.  </span><span id="en24871">In a community, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural becomes perfectly natural in the community.  </span><span id="en24873">It all depends on the environment.  </span><span id="en24875">It's all the environment and man himself is nothing.  </span><span id="en24877">And I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof that she never regarded me as having wronged her.  </span><span id="en24879">I am trying now to attract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.  </span><span id="en24881">What are you laughing at?  </span><span id="en24883">We are trying to establish a community of our own, a special one, on a broader basis.  </span><span id="en24885">We have gone further in our convictions.  </span><span id="en24887">We reject more!  </span><span id="en24889">And meanwhile I'm still developing Sofya Semyonovna.  </span><span id="en24891">She has a beautiful, beautiful character!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24894">"And you take advantage of her fine character, eh?  </span><span id="en24896">He-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24899">"No, no!  </span><span id="en24901">Oh, no!  </span><span id="en24903">On the contrary." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24906">"Oh, on the contrary!  </span><span id="en24908">He-he-he!  </span><span id="en24910">A queer thing to say!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24913">"Believe me!  </span><span id="en24915">Why should I disguise it?  </span><span id="en24917">In fact, I feel it strange myself how timid, chaste and modern she is with me!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24920">"And you, of course, are developing her...  </span><span id="en24922">he-he!  </span><span id="en24924">trying to prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24927">"Not at all, not at all!  </span><span id="en24929">How coarsely, how stupidly—excuse me saying so—you misunderstand the word development!  </span><span id="en24931">Good heavens, how...  </span><span id="en24933">crude you still are!  </span><span id="en24935">We are striving for the freedom of women and you have only one idea in your head....  </span><span id="en24937">Setting aside the general question of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that's for her to decide.  </span><span id="en24939">Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me, I should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but as it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more respect for her dignity...  </span><span id="en24941">I wait in hopes, that's all!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24944">"You had much better make her a present of something.  </span><span id="en24946">I bet you never thought of that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24949">"You don't understand, as I've told you already!  </span><span id="en24951">Of course, she is in such a position, but it's another question.  </span><span id="en24953">Quite another question!  </span><span id="en24955">You simply despise her.  </span><span id="en24957">Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature.  </span><span id="en24959">You don't know what a character she is!  </span><span id="en24961">I am only sorry that of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books.  </span><span id="en24963">I used to lend them to her.  </span><span id="en24965">I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and resolution in protesting—which she has already shown once—she has little self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas.  </span><span id="en24967">Yet she thoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of hands, that is, that it's an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her hand, because it's a sign of inequality.  </span><span id="en24969">We had a debate about it and I described it to her.  </span><span id="en24971">She listened attentively to an account of the workmen's associations in France, too.  </span><span id="en24973">Now I am explaining the question of coming into the room in the future society." </span></p>
<p><span id="en24976">"And what's that, pray?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24979">"We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community the right to enter another member's room, whether man or woman, at any time...  </span><span id="en24981">and we decided that he has!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24984">"It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en24987">Lebeziatnikov was really angry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en24990">"You are always thinking of something unpleasant," he cried with aversion. " </span><span id="en24992">Tfoo!  </span><span id="en24994">How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy!  </span><span id="en24996">It's always a stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before they understand it.  </span><span id="en24998">And how proud they are of it, too!  </span><span id="en25000">Tfoo!  </span><span id="en25002">I've often maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till he has a firm faith in the system.  </span><span id="en25004">And tell me, please, what do you find so shameful even in cesspools?  </span><span id="en25006">I should be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you like.  </span><span id="en25008">And it's not a question of self-sacrifice, it's simply work, honourable, useful work which is as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin, because it is more useful." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25011">"And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25014">"What do you mean by 'more honourable'?  </span><span id="en25016">I don't understand such expressions to describe human activity.  </span><span id="en25018">'More honourable,' 'nobler'—all those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject.  </span><span id="en25019">Everything which is  </span><i><span id="en25020">of use </span></i><span id="en25021">  </span><span id="en25022">to mankind is honourable.  </span><span id="en25023">I only understand one word:  </span><i><span id="en25024">useful </span></i><span id="en25026">! You can snigger as much as you like, but that's so!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25031">Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily.  </span><span id="en25033">He had finished counting the money and was putting it away.  </span><span id="en25035">But some of the notes he left on the table.  </span><span id="en25037">The "cesspool question" had already been a subject of dispute between them.  </span><span id="en25039">What was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his young friend. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25042">"It's your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and annoying," blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his "independence" and his "protests" did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25045">"You'd better tell me this," Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty displeasure, "can you...  </span><span id="en25047">or rather are you really friendly enough with that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute?  </span><span id="en25049">I think they've all come back from the cemetery...  </span><span id="en25051">I heard the sound of steps...  </span><span id="en25053">I want to see her, that young person." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25056">"What for?"  </span><span id="en25058">Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25061">"Oh, I want to.  </span><span id="en25063">I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I wanted to speak to her about...  </span><span id="en25065">However, you may be present during the interview.  </span><span id="en25067">It's better you should be, indeed.  </span><span id="en25069">For there's no knowing what you might imagine." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25072">"I shan't imagine anything.  </span><span id="en25074">I only asked and, if you've anything to say to her, nothing is easier than to call her in.  </span><span id="en25076">I'll go directly and you may be sure I won't be in your way." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25079">Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia.  </span><span id="en25081">She came in very much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual.  </span><span id="en25083">She was always shy in such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as a child and was even more so now....  </span><span id="en25084">Pyotr Petrovitch met her "politely and affably," but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so young and so  </span><i><span id="en25085">interesting </span></i><span id="en25086">  </span><span id="en25087">as she.  </span><span id="en25089">He hastened to "reassure" her and made her sit down facing him at the table.  </span><span id="en25091">Sonia sat down, looked about her—at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes remained riveted on him.  </span><span id="en25093">Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door.  </span><span id="en25095">Pyotr Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25099">"Is Raskolnikov in there?  </span><span id="en25101">Has he come?"  </span><span id="en25103">he asked him in a whisper. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25106">"Raskolnikov?  </span><span id="en25108">Yes.  </span><span id="en25110">Why?  </span><span id="en25112">Yes, he is there.  </span><span id="en25114">I saw him just come in....  </span><span id="en25116">Why?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25119">"Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave me alone with this...  </span><span id="en25121">young woman.  </span><span id="en25123">I only want a few words with her, but God knows what they may make of it.  </span><span id="en25125">I shouldn't like Raskolnikov to repeat anything....  </span><span id="en25127">You understand what I mean?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25130">"I understand!"  </span><span id="en25132">Lebeziatnikov saw the point. " </span><span id="en25134">Yes, you are right....  </span><span id="en25136">Of course, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy, but...  </span><span id="en25138">still, you are right.  </span><span id="en25140">Certainly I'll stay.  </span><span id="en25142">I'll stand here at the window and not be in your way...  </span><span id="en25144">I think you are right..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25147">Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe expression, as much as to say, "don't you make any mistake, madam."  </span><span id="en25149">Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25152">"In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your respected mamma....  </span><span id="en25154">That's right, isn't it?  </span><span id="en25156">Katerina Ivanovna stands in the place of a mother to you?"  </span><span id="en25158">Pyotr Petrovitch began with great dignity, though affably. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25161">It was evident that his intentions were friendly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25164">"Quite so, yes; the place of a mother," Sonia answered, timidly and hurriedly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25167">"Then will you make my apologies to her?  </span><span id="en25169">Through inevitable circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in spite of your mamma's kind invitation." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25172">"Yes...  </span><span id="en25174">I'll tell her...  </span><span id="en25176">at once." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25179">And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25182">"Wait, that's not all," Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners, "and you know me little, my dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only.  </span><span id="en25184">I have another object." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25187">Sonia sat down hurriedly.  </span><span id="en25189">Her eyes rested again for an instant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en25190">She felt it horribly indecorous, especially for  </span><i><span id="en25191">her </span></i><span id="en25193">, to look at another person's money.  </span><span id="en25195">She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger.  </span><span id="en25197">But suddenly she looked away and, not knowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight in the face.  </span><span id="en25199">After a pause of still greater dignity he continued. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25203">"I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman.  </span><span id="en25205">That was sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position—preternatural, if one may so express it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25208">"Yes...  </span><span id="en25210">preternatural..."  </span><span id="en25212">Sonia hurriedly assented. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25215">"Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25218">"Yes, simpler and more comprehen...  </span><span id="en25220">yes, ill." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25223">"Quite so.  </span><span id="en25225">So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way, foreseeing her unfortunate position.  </span><span id="en25227">I believe the whole of this poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25230">"Allow me to ask," Sonia rose to her feet, "did you say something to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension?  </span><span id="en25232">Because she told me you had undertaken to get her one.  </span><span id="en25234">Was that true?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25237">"Not in the slightest, and indeed it's an absurdity!  </span><span id="en25239">I merely hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had died in the service—if only she has patronage...  </span><span id="en25241">but apparently your late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all of late.  </span><span id="en25243">In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be very ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in that case, far from it....  </span><span id="en25245">And she is dreaming of a pension already, he-he-he!...  </span><span id="en25247">A go-ahead lady!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25250">"Yes, she is.  </span><span id="en25252">For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes everything from the goodness of her heart and...  </span><span id="en25254">and...  </span><span id="en25256">and she is like that...  </span><span id="en25258">yes...  </span><span id="en25260">You must excuse her," said Sonia, and again she got up to go. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25263">"But you haven't heard what I have to say." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25266">"No, I haven't heard," muttered Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25269">"Then sit down."  </span><span id="en25271">She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third time. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25274">"Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad, as I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service, that is, so far as is in my power, not more.  </span><span id="en25276">One might for instance get up a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous of assisting people.  </span><span id="en25278">It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might be done." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25281">"Yes, yes...  </span><span id="en25283">God will repay you for it," faltered Sonia, gazing intently at Pyotr Petrovitch. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25286">"It might be, but we will talk of it later.  </span><span id="en25288">We might begin it to-day, we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak.  </span><span id="en25290">Come to me at seven o'clock.  </span><span id="en25292">Mr.  </span><span id="en25294">Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us.  </span><span id="en25296">But there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and for which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here.  </span><span id="en25298">In my opinion money cannot be, indeed it's unsafe to put it into Katerina Ivanovna's own hands.  </span><span id="en25300">The dinner to-day is a proof of that.  </span><span id="en25302">Though she has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and...  </span><span id="en25304">well, boots or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even, I believe, Madeira and...  </span><span id="en25306">and coffee.  </span><span id="en25308">I saw it as I passed through.  </span><span id="en25310">To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won't have a crust of bread.  </span><span id="en25312">It's absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but only you, for instance.  </span><span id="en25314">Am I right?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25317">"I don't know...  </span><span id="en25319">this is only to-day, once in her life....  </span><span id="en25321">She was so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory....  </span><span id="en25323">And she is very sensible...  </span><span id="en25325">but just as you think and I shall be very, very...  </span><span id="en25327">they will all be...  </span><span id="en25329">and God will reward...  </span><span id="en25331">and the orphans..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25334">Sonia burst into tears. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25337">"Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me personally.  </span><span id="en25339">I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in connection with it.  </span><span id="en25341">Here...  </span><span id="en25343">having so to speak anxieties of my own, I cannot do more..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25346">And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully unfolded.  </span><span id="en25348">Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something and began taking leave.  </span><span id="en25350">Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously to the door.  </span><span id="en25352">She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed, and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25355">All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25357">"I heard and  </span><i><span id="en25358">saw </span></i><span id="en25359">  </span><span id="en25360">everything," he said, laying stress on the last verb. " </span><span id="en25362">That is honourable, I mean to say, it's humane!  </span><span id="en25364">You wanted to avoid gratitude, I saw!  </span><span id="en25366">And although I cannot, I confess, in principle sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with pleasure—yes, yes, I like it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25370">"That's all nonsense," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted, looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25373">"No, it's not nonsense!  </span><span id="en25375">A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others, such a man...  </span><span id="en25377">even though he is making a social mistake—is still deserving of respect!  </span><span id="en25379">I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr Petrovitch, especially as according to your ideas...  </span><span id="en25381">oh, what a drawback your ideas are to you!  </span><span id="en25383">How distressed you are for instance by your ill-luck yesterday," cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. " </span><span id="en25384">And, what do you want with marriage, with  </span><i><span id="en25385">legal </span></i><span id="en25386">  </span><span id="en25387">marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch?  </span><span id="en25388">Why do you cling to this  </span><i><span id="en25389">legality </span></i><span id="en25390">  </span><span id="en25391">of marriage?  </span><span id="en25393">Well, you may beat me if you like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn't come off, that you are free, that you are not quite lost for humanity....  </span><span id="en25395">you see, I've spoken my mind!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25400">"Because I don't want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and to bring up another man's children, that's why I want legal marriage," Luzhin replied in order to make some answer. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25403">He seemed preoccupied by something. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25406">"Children?  </span><span id="en25408">You referred to children," Lebeziatnikov started off like a warhorse at the trumpet call. " </span><span id="en25410">Children are a social question and a question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has another solution.  </span><span id="en25412">Some refuse to have children altogether, because they suggest the institution of the family.  </span><span id="en25414">We'll speak of children later, but now as to the question of honour, I confess that's my weak point.  </span><span id="en25416">That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future.  </span><span id="en25418">What does it mean indeed?  </span><span id="en25420">It's nonsense, there will be no deception in a free marriage!  </span><span id="en25422">That is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.  </span><span id="en25424">So that indeed it's not humiliating...  </span><span id="en25426">and if I ever, to suppose an absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of it.  </span><span id="en25428">I should say to my wife: 'My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now I respect you, for you've shown you can protest! </span><span id="en25430">' You laugh!  </span><span id="en25432">That's because you are of incapable of getting away from prejudices.  </span><span id="en25434">Confound it all!  </span><span id="en25436">I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage, but it's simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated.  </span><span id="en25438">When the deception is open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it's unthinkable.  </span><span id="en25440">Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for her new husband.  </span><span id="en25442">Damn it all!  </span><span id="en25444">I sometimes dream if I were to be married, pfoo!  </span><span id="en25446">I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it's just the same, I should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for herself.  </span><span id="en25448">'My dear,' I should say, 'I love you, but even more than that I desire you to respect me.  </span><span id="en25450">See! </span><span id="en25452">' Am I not right?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25455">Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.  </span><span id="en25457">He hardly heard it indeed.  </span><span id="en25459">He was preoccupied with something else and even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it.  </span><span id="en25461">Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed his hands.  </span><span id="en25463">Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected upon it afterwards. </span></p>

<p><span id="en25467">It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna's disordered brain.  </span><span id="en25469">Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov's funeral, were wasted upon it.  </span><span id="en25471">Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to honour the memory of the deceased "suitably," that all the lodgers, and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know "that he was in no way their inferior, and perhaps very much their superior," and that no one had the right "to turn up his nose at him."  </span><span id="en25473">Perhaps the chief element was that peculiar "poor man's pride," which compels many poor people to spend their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order to do "like other people," and not to "be looked down upon."  </span><span id="en25475">It is very probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those "wretched contemptible lodgers" that she knew "how to do things, how to entertain" and that she had been brought up "in a genteel, she might almost say aristocratic colonel's family" and had not been meant for sweeping floors and washing the children's rags at night.  </span><span id="en25477">Even the poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving.  </span><span id="en25479">And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will could not be crushed.  </span><span id="en25481">Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her mind was unhinged.  </span><span id="en25483">She could not be said to be insane, but for a year past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.  </span><span id="en25485">The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the intellect. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25488">There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine there was.  </span><span id="en25490">There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity.  </span><span id="en25492">Besides the traditional rice and honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna's kitchen.  </span><span id="en25494">Two samovars were boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner.  </span><span id="en25496">Katerina Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been stranded at Madame Lippevechsel's.  </span><span id="en25498">He promptly put himself at Katerina Ivanovna's disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious that everyone should be aware of it.  </span><span id="en25499">For every trifle he ran to Katerina Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called her " </span><i><span id="en25500">Pani </span></i><span id="en25502">." She was heartily sick of him before the end, though she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this "serviceable and magnanimous man."  </span><span id="en25504">It was one of Katerina Ivanovna's characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.  </span><span id="en25506">Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality.  </span><span id="en25508">Then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring.  </span><span id="en25509">She was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so  </span><i><span id="en25510">keenly </span></i><span id="en25511"> that all should live in peace and joy and should not  </span><i><span id="en25512">dare </span></i><span id="en25513">  </span><span id="en25514">to break the peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against the wall. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25520">Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in Katerina Ivanovna's eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparations.  </span><span id="en25522">She had undertaken to lay the table, to provide the linen, crockery, etc. </span><span id="en25524">, and to cook the dishes in her kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone herself to the cemetery.  </span><span id="en25526">Everything had been well done.  </span><span id="en25528">Even the table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride.  </span><span id="en25530">This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for some reason: "as though the table could not have been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna!"  </span><span id="en25532">She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. " </span><span id="en25534">Could she be stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house, and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers!  </span><span id="en25536">As a favour!  </span><span id="en25538">Fancy that!  </span><span id="en25540">Katerina Ivanovna's father who had been a colonel and almost a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been allowed into the kitchen." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25543">Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the time and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was fancying herself.  </span><span id="en25545">Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober.  </span><span id="en25547">The older and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.  </span><span id="en25549">Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna, Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had been a friend of her first husband's, and a guest in her father's house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a considerable pension.  </span><span id="en25551">It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna exalted anyone's connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person praised.  </span><span id="en25553">Probably "taking his cue" from Luzhin, "that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either.  </span><span id="en25555">What did he fancy himself?  </span><span id="en25557">He was only asked out of kindness and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a friend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25560">Among those who failed to appear were "the genteel lady and her old-maidish daughter," who had only been lodgers in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna's room, especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk.  </span><span id="en25562">Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who, quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole family out of doors, had shouted at her that they "were not worth the foot" of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing.  </span><span id="en25564">Katerina Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, "whose foot she was not worth," and who had turned away haughtily when she casually met them, so that they might know that "she was more noble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice," and might see that she was not accustomed to her way of living.  </span><span id="en25566">She had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father's governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid of them to turn away on meeting her.  </span><span id="en25568">The fat colonel-major (he was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it appeared that he had been "not himself" for the last two days.  </span><span id="en25570">The party consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone at Amalia Ivanovna's. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25573">A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy—was without a waistcoat!  </span><span id="en25575">One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without even greeting Katerina Ivanovna.  </span><span id="en25577">Finally one person having no suit appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him.  </span><span id="en25579">The Pole brought with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna's and whom no one had seen here before.  </span><span id="en25581">All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna intensely. " </span><span id="en25583">For whom had they made all these preparations then?"  </span><span id="en25585">To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred children's. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25588">Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with increased dignity, and even haughtiness.  </span><span id="en25590">She stared at some of them with special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats.  </span><span id="en25592">Rushing to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the latter promptly observed and resented.  </span><span id="en25594">Such a beginning was no good omen for the end.  </span><span id="en25596">All were seated at last. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25599">Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery.  </span><span id="en25601">Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the first place, because he was the one "educated visitor, and, as everyone knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university," and secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral.  </span><span id="en25603">She positively pounced upon him, and made him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right).  </span><span id="en25605">In spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to Raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of her landlady. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25608">"It's all that cuckoo's fault!  </span><span id="en25610">You know whom I mean?  </span><span id="en25612">Her, her!"  </span><span id="en25614">Katerina Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. " </span><span id="en25616">Look at her, she's making round eyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can't understand.  </span><span id="en25618">Pfoo, the owl!  </span><span id="en25620">Ha-ha!  </span><span id="en25622">(Cough-cough-cough. </span><span id="en25624">) And what does she put on that cap for?  </span><span id="en25626">(Cough-cough-cough. </span><span id="en25628">) Have you noticed that she wants everyone to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being here?  </span><span id="en25630">I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially those who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has brought!  </span><span id="en25632">The sweeps!  </span><span id="en25634">Look at that one with the spotty face.  </span><span id="en25636">And those wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha!  </span><span id="en25638">(Cough-cough-cough. </span><span id="en25640">) Not one of them has ever poked his nose in here, I've never set eyes on them.  </span><span id="en25642">What have they come here for, I ask you?  </span><span id="en25644">There they sit in a row.  </span><span id="en25645">Hey,  </span><i><span id="en25646">pan </span></i><span id="en25648">!" she cried suddenly to one of them, "have you tasted the pancakes?  </span><span id="en25650">Take some more!  </span><span id="en25652">Have some beer!  </span><span id="en25654">Won't you have some vodka?  </span><span id="en25656">Look, he's jumped up and is making his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things.  </span><span id="en25658">Never mind, let them eat!  </span><span id="en25660">They don't make a noise, anyway, though I'm really afraid for our landlady's silver spoons...  </span><span id="en25662">Amalia Ivanovna!"  </span><span id="en25664">she addressed her suddenly, almost aloud, "if your spoons should happen to be stolen, I won't be responsible, I warn you!  </span><span id="en25666">Ha-ha-ha!"  </span><span id="en25668">She laughed turning to Raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her sally. " </span><span id="en25670">She didn't understand, she didn't understand again!  </span><span id="en25672">Look how she sits with her mouth open!  </span><span id="en25674">An owl, a real owl!  </span><span id="en25676">An owl in new ribbons, ha-ha-ha!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25680">Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes.  </span><span id="en25682">Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained with blood.  </span><span id="en25684">She showed Raskolnikov the blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her cheeks. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25687">"Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak, for inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am speaking?  </span><span id="en25689">It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that provincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody knows it)...  </span><span id="en25691">a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners required!  </span><span id="en25693">I can't understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come?  </span><span id="en25695">But where's Sonia?  </span><span id="en25697">Where has she gone?  </span><span id="en25699">Ah, there she is at last!  </span><span id="en25701">what is it, Sonia, where have you been?  </span><span id="en25703">It's odd that even at your father's funeral you should be so unpunctual.  </span><span id="en25705">Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her beside you.  </span><span id="en25707">That's your place, Sonia...  </span><span id="en25709">take what you like.  </span><span id="en25711">Have some of the cold entrée with jelly, that's the best.  </span><span id="en25713">They'll bring the pancakes directly.  </span><span id="en25715">Have they given the children some?  </span><span id="en25717">Polenka, have you got everything?  </span><span id="en25719">(Cough-cough-cough. </span><span id="en25721">) That's all right.  </span><span id="en25723">Be a good girl, Lida, and, Kolya, don't fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.  </span><span id="en25725">What are you saying, Sonia?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25728">Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch's apologies, trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en25729">She added that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as he possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss  </span><i><span id="en25730">business </span></i><span id="en25731">  </span><span id="en25732">alone with her and to consider what could be done for her, etc. </span><span id="en25734">, etc. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25738">Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her and gratify her pride.  </span><span id="en25740">She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a hurried bow, glancing curiously at him.  </span><span id="en25742">But for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him.  </span><span id="en25744">She seemed absent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying to please her.  </span><span id="en25746">Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her only dress, a dark striped cotton one. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25749">The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful.  </span><span id="en25751">Listening to Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of Pyotr Petrovitch's position and standing to find himself in such "extraordinary company," in spite of his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her father. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25754">"That's why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have not disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings," she added almost aloud. " </span><span id="en25756">But I am sure that it was only your special affection for my poor husband that has made you keep your promise." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25759">Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: "Wouldn't he have some more meat, and had he been given some wine?"  </span><span id="en25761">The old man made no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked, though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him.  </span><span id="en25763">He simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the general mirth. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25766">"What an imbecile!  </span><span id="en25768">Look, look!  </span><span id="en25770">Why was he brought?  </span><span id="en25772">But as to Pyotr Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him," Katerina Ivanovna continued, "and, of course, he is not like..."  </span><span id="en25774">with an extremely stern face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite disconcerted, "not like your dressed up draggletails whom my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the goodness of his heart." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25777">"Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!"  </span><span id="en25779">cried the commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25782">"My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows it," Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, "but he was a kind and honourable man, who loved and respected his family.  </span><span id="en25784">The worst of it was his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe.  </span><span id="en25786">Would you believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25789">"A cock?  </span><span id="en25791">Did you say a cock?"  </span><span id="en25793">shouted the commissariat clerk. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25796">Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply.  </span><span id="en25798">She sighed, lost in thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25801">"No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him," she went on, addressing Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en25803">But that's not so!  </span><span id="en25805">He respected me, he respected me very much!  </span><span id="en25807">He was a kind-hearted man!  </span><span id="en25809">And how sorry I was for him sometimes!  </span><span id="en25811">He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would think to myself: 'Be kind to him and he will drink again,' it was only by severity that you could keep him within bounds." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25814">"Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often," roared the commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25817">"Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having their hair pulled.  </span><span id="en25819">I am not talking of my late husband now!"  </span><span id="en25821">Katerina Ivanovna snapped at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25824">The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved.  </span><span id="en25826">In another minute she would have been ready to make a scene.  </span><span id="en25828">Many of the visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted.  </span><span id="en25830">They began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering something to him.  </span><span id="en25832">They were evidently trying to egg him on. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25835">"Allow me to ask what are you alluding to," began the clerk, "that is to say, whose...  </span><span id="en25837">about whom...  </span><span id="en25839">did you say just now...  </span><span id="en25841">But I don't care!  </span><span id="en25843">That's nonsense!  </span><span id="en25845">Widow!  </span><span id="en25847">I forgive you....  </span><span id="en25849">Pass!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25852">And he took another drink of vodka. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25855">Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust.  </span><span id="en25857">He only ate from politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually putting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings.  </span><span id="en25859">He watched Sonia intently.  </span><span id="en25861">But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she, too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with terror Katerina Ivanovna's growing irritation.  </span><span id="en25863">She knew that she, Sonia, was the chief reason for the 'genteel' ladies' contemptuous treatment of Katerina Ivanovna's invitation.  </span><span id="en25864">She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question: "How could she let her daughter sit down beside  </span><i><span id="en25865">that young person </span></i><span id="en25867">?" Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an insult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, "till she had shown those draggletails that they were both..."  </span><span id="en25869">To make matters worse someone passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread.  </span><span id="en25871">Katerina Ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it was "a drunken ass!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25875">Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna's haughtiness, and to restore the good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began, apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers "Karl from the chemist's," who was driving one night in a cab, and that "the cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill, and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his heart."  </span><span id="en25876">Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was still more offended, and she retorted that her " </span><i><span id="en25877">Vater aus Berlin </span></i><span id="en25878">  </span><span id="en25879">was a very important man, and always went with his hands in pockets."  </span><span id="en25881">Katerina Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25885">"Listen to the owl!"  </span><span id="en25887">Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her good-humour almost restored, "she meant to say he kept his hands in his pockets, but she said he put his hands in people's pockets.  </span><span id="en25889">(Cough-cough. </span><span id="en25891">) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than we!  </span><span id="en25893">Can you fancy anyone of us telling how 'Karl from the chemist's' 'pierced his heart from fear' and that the idiot, instead of punishing the cabman, 'clasped his hands and wept, and much begged. </span><span id="en25895">' Ah, the fool!  </span><span id="en25897">And you know she fancies it's very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is!  </span><span id="en25899">To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious....  </span><span id="en25901">Look how she sits glaring!  </span><span id="en25903">She is angry, ha-ha!  </span><span id="en25905">(Cough-cough-cough. </span><span id="en25906">)" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25908">Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T——.  </span><span id="en25910">This was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she launched out into the most alluring details.  </span><span id="en25912">It suddenly appeared that Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personages on leaving school.  </span><span id="en25914">This certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina Ivanovna's right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming "those two stuck-up draggletails" if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, "she might even say aristocratic family, a colonel's daughter and was far superior to certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late."  </span><span id="en25915">The certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually contained the statement  </span><i><span id="en25916">en toutes lettres </span></i><span id="en25918">, that her father was of the rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really was almost the daughter of a colonel. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25922">Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in T——, on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most respectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in T——, and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms.  </span><span id="en25924">Next she spoke of Sonia who would go with her to T—— and help her in all her plans.  </span><span id="en25926">At this someone at the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25929">Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of Sonia's undoubted ability to assist her, of "her gentleness, patience, devotion, generosity and good education," tapping Sonia on the cheek and kissing her warmly twice.  </span><span id="en25931">Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was "nervous and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25933">At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort, and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation, that "in the future boarding-school she would have to pay particular attention to  </span><i><span id="en25934">die Wäsche </span></i><span id="en25935">, and that there certainly must be a good  </span><i><span id="en25936">dame </span></i><span id="en25937">  </span><span id="en25938">to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night read." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25942">Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying "she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class boarding-school to look after  </span><i><span id="en25943">die Wäsche </span></i><span id="en25945">, and as for novel-reading, that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent."  </span><span id="en25946">Amalia Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only "meant her good," and that "she had meant her very good," and that "it was long since she had paid her  </span><i><span id="en25947">gold </span></i><span id="en25948">  </span><span id="en25949">for the lodgings." </span></p>
<p><span id="en25954">Katerina Ivanovna at once "set her down," saying that it was a lie to say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings.  </span><span id="en25955">To this Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those ladies, but "those ladies had not come, because those ladies  </span><i><span id="en25956">are </span></i><span id="en25957">  </span><span id="en25958">ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady."  </span><span id="en25960">Katerina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge what made one really a lady.  </span><span id="en25961">Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her " </span><i><span id="en25962">Vater aus Berlin </span></i><span id="en25963">  </span><span id="en25964">was a very, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, and always used to say: 'Poof!  </span><span id="en25966">poof! </span><span id="en25968">'" and she leapt up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling "poof!  </span><span id="en25970">poof!"  </span><span id="en25972">amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25977">But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared, so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a cook and probably something worse.  </span><span id="en25978">Amalia Ivanovna turned as red as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a father, "but she had a  </span><i><span id="en25979">Vater aus Berlin </span></i><span id="en25980">  </span><span id="en25981">and that he wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en25985">Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna's father—if she really had one—was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna. </span></p>
<p><span id="en25987">At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist, and shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, "that her  </span><i><span id="en25988">Vater </span></i><span id="en25989"> was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that Katerina Ivanovna's  </span><i><span id="en25990">Vater </span></i><span id="en25991">  </span><span id="en25992">was quite never a burgomeister."  </span><span id="en25994">Katerina Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that "if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot."  </span><span id="en25996">Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room, shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.  </span><span id="en25998">There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying.  </span><span id="en26000">Sonia ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted something about "the yellow ticket," Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26005">At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared on the threshold.  </span><span id="en26007">He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes.  </span><span id="en26009">Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him. </span></p>

<p><span id="en26013">"Pyotr Petrovitch," she cried, "protect me...  </span><span id="en26015">you at least!  </span><span id="en26017">Make this foolish woman understand that she can't behave like this to a lady in misfortune...  </span><span id="en26019">that there is a law for such things....  </span><span id="en26021">I'll go to the governor-general himself....  </span><span id="en26023">She shall answer for it....  </span><span id="en26025">Remembering my father's hospitality protect these orphans." </span></p>
<p><span id="en26028">"Allow me, madam....  </span><span id="en26030">Allow me."  </span><span id="en26032">Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. " </span><span id="en26034">Your papa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing" (someone laughed aloud) "and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna....  </span><span id="en26036">I have come here to speak of my own affairs...  </span><span id="en26038">and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...  </span><span id="en26040">Ivanovna, I think it is?  </span><span id="en26042">Allow me to pass." </span></p>
<p><span id="en26045">Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia was. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26048">Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though thunderstruck.  </span><span id="en26050">She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her father's hospitality.  </span><span id="en26052">Though she had invented it herself, she believed in it firmly by this time.  </span><span id="en26054">She was struck too by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en26056">All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance.  </span><span id="en26058">Not only was this "serious business man" strikingly incongruous with the rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him and that therefore something was going to happen.  </span><span id="en26060">Raskolnikov, standing beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not seem to notice him.  </span><span id="en26062">A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26065">"Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it's a matter of some importance," Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company generally. " </span><span id="en26067">I am glad indeed to find other persons present.  </span><span id="en26069">Amalia Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna.  </span><span id="en26071">Sofya Ivanovna," he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already alarmed, "immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.  </span><span id="en26073">Lebeziatnikov.  </span><span id="en26075">If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where it is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to witness that the matter shall end there.  </span><span id="en26077">In the opposite case I shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then...  </span><span id="en26079">you must blame yourself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en26082">Complete silence reigned in the room.  </span><span id="en26084">Even the crying children were still.  </span><span id="en26086">Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a word.  </span><span id="en26088">She seemed not to understand.  </span><span id="en26090">Some seconds passed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26093">"Well, how is it to be then?"  </span><span id="en26095">asked Luzhin, looking intently at her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26098">"I don't know....  </span><span id="en26100">I know nothing about it," Sonia articulated faintly at last. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26103">"No, you know nothing?"  </span><span id="en26105">Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some seconds. " </span><span id="en26107">Think a moment, mademoiselle," he began severely, but still, as it were, admonishing her. " </span><span id="en26109">Reflect, I am prepared to give you time for consideration.  </span><span id="en26111">Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely convinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to accuse you so directly.  </span><span id="en26113">Seeing that for such direct accusation before witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense be made responsible, I am aware of that.  </span><span id="en26115">This morning I changed for my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of approximately three thousand roubles.  </span><span id="en26117">The account is noted down in my pocket-book.  </span><span id="en26119">On my return home I proceeded to count the money—as Mr.  </span><span id="en26121">Lebeziatnikov will bear witness—and after counting two thousand three hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.  </span><span id="en26123">About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three notes of a hundred roubles each.  </span><span id="en26125">At that moment you entered (at my invitation)—and all the time you were present you were exceedingly embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off.  </span><span id="en26127">Mr.  </span><span id="en26129">Lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this.  </span><span id="en26131">You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm my statement that I invited you through Mr.  </span><span id="en26133">Lebeziatnikov, solely in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend), and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a subscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit.  </span><span id="en26135">You thanked me and even shed tears.  </span><span id="en26137">I describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my recollection.  </span><span id="en26139">Then I took a ten-rouble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative.  </span><span id="en26141">Mr.  </span><span id="en26143">Lebeziatnikov saw all this.  </span><span id="en26145">Then I accompanied you to the door—you being still in the same state of embarrassment—after which, being left alone with Mr.  </span><span id="en26147">Lebeziatnikov I talked to him for ten minutes—then Mr.  </span><span id="en26149">Lebeziatnikov went out and I returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before.  </span><span id="en26151">To my surprise one hundred-rouble note had disappeared.  </span><span id="en26153">Kindly consider the position.  </span><span id="en26155">Mr.  </span><span id="en26157">Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect.  </span><span id="en26159">I am ashamed to allude to such a supposition.  </span><span id="en26161">I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the total correct.  </span><span id="en26162">You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and positively against my will,  </span><i><span id="en26163">compelled </span></i><span id="en26164">  </span><span id="en26165">to entertain a suspicion—a cruel, but justifiable suspicion!  </span><span id="en26167">I will add further and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass.  </span><span id="en26169">I have taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing to your black ingratitude!  </span><span id="en26171">Why!  </span><span id="en26173">I invite you for the benefit of your destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action.  </span><span id="en26175">It is too bad!  </span><span id="en26177">You need a lesson.  </span><span id="en26179">Reflect!  </span><span id="en26181">Moreover, like a true friend I beg you—and you could have no better friend at this moment—think what you are doing, otherwise I shall be immovable!  </span><span id="en26183">Well, what do you say?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26187">"I have taken nothing," Sonia whispered in terror, "you gave me ten roubles, here it is, take it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en26190">Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it, took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26193">"And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?"  </span><span id="en26195">he insisted reproachfully, not taking the note. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26198">Sonia looked about her.  </span><span id="en26200">All were looking at her with such awful, stern, ironical, hostile eyes.  </span><span id="en26202">She looked at Raskolnikov...  </span><span id="en26204">he stood against the wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26207">"Good God!"  </span><span id="en26209">broke from Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26212">"Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter," Luzhin said softly and even kindly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26214">" </span><i><span id="en26215">Gott der Barmherzige </span></i><span id="en26217">! I knew she was the thief," cried Amalia Ivanovna, throwing up her hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26221">"You knew it?"  </span><span id="en26223">Luzhin caught her up, "then I suppose you had some reason before this for thinking so.  </span><span id="en26225">I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses." </span></p>
<p><span id="en26228">There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides.  </span><span id="en26230">All were in movement. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26233">"What!"  </span><span id="en26235">cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and she rushed at Luzhin. " </span><span id="en26237">What!  </span><span id="en26239">You accuse her of stealing?  </span><span id="en26241">Sonia?  </span><span id="en26243">Ah, the wretches, the wretches!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26246">And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as in a vise. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26249">"Sonia!  </span><span id="en26251">how dared you take ten roubles from him?  </span><span id="en26253">Foolish girl!  </span><span id="en26255">Give it to me!  </span><span id="en26257">Give me the ten roubles at once—here!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26260">And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and flung it straight into Luzhin's face.  </span><span id="en26262">It hit him in the eye and fell on the ground.  </span><span id="en26264">Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up.  </span><span id="en26266">Pyotr Petrovitch lost his temper. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26269">"Hold that mad woman!"  </span><span id="en26271">he shouted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26274">At that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in the doorway, among them the two ladies. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26277">"What!  </span><span id="en26279">Mad?  </span><span id="en26281">Am I mad?  </span><span id="en26283">Idiot!"  </span><span id="en26285">shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. " </span><span id="en26287">You are an idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man!  </span><span id="en26289">Sonia, Sonia take his money!  </span><span id="en26291">Sonia a thief!  </span><span id="en26293">Why, she'd give away her last penny!"  </span><span id="en26295">and Katerina Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. " </span><span id="en26297">Did you ever see such an idiot?"  </span><span id="en26299">she turned from side to side. " </span><span id="en26301">And you too?"  </span><span id="en26303">she suddenly saw the landlady, "and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a thief, you trashy Prussian hen's leg in a crinoline!  </span><span id="en26305">She hasn't been out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down beside me, everyone saw her.  </span><span id="en26307">She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en26309">Search her!  </span><span id="en26311">Since she's not left the room, the money would have to be on her!  </span><span id="en26313">Search her, search her!  </span><span id="en26315">But if you don't find it, then excuse me, my dear fellow, you'll answer for it!  </span><span id="en26317">I'll go to our Sovereign, to our Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet, to-day, this minute!  </span><span id="en26319">I am alone in the world!  </span><span id="en26321">They would let me in!  </span><span id="en26323">Do you think they wouldn't?  </span><span id="en26325">You're wrong, I will get in!  </span><span id="en26327">I will get in!  </span><span id="en26329">You reckoned on her meekness!  </span><span id="en26331">You relied upon that!  </span><span id="en26333">But I am not so submissive, let me tell you!  </span><span id="en26335">You've gone too far yourself.  </span><span id="en26337">Search her, search her!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26340">And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26343">"I am ready, I'll be responsible...  </span><span id="en26345">but calm yourself, madam, calm yourself.  </span><span id="en26347">I see that you are not so submissive!...  </span><span id="en26349">Well, well, but as to that..."  </span><span id="en26351">Luzhin muttered, "that ought to be before the police...  </span><span id="en26353">though indeed there are witnesses enough as it is....  </span><span id="en26355">I am ready....  </span><span id="en26357">But in any case it's difficult for a man...  </span><span id="en26359">on account of her sex....  </span><span id="en26361">But with the help of Amalia Ivanovna...  </span><span id="en26363">though, of course, it's not the way to do things....  </span><span id="en26365">How is it to be done?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26368">"As you will!  </span><span id="en26370">Let anyone who likes search her!"  </span><span id="en26372">cried Katerina Ivanovna. " </span><span id="en26374">Sonia, turn out your pockets!  </span><span id="en26376">See!  </span><span id="en26378">Look, monster, the pocket is empty, here was her handkerchief!  </span><span id="en26380">Here is the other pocket, look!  </span><span id="en26382">D'you see, d'you see?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26385">And Katerina Ivanovna turned—or rather snatched—both pockets inside out.  </span><span id="en26387">But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin's feet.  </span><span id="en26389">Everyone saw it, several cried out.  </span><span id="en26391">Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it.  </span><span id="en26393">It was a hundred-rouble note folded in eight.  </span><span id="en26395">Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note showing it to everyone. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26398">"Thief!  </span><span id="en26400">Out of my lodging.  </span><span id="en26402">Police, police!"  </span><span id="en26404">yelled Amalia Ivanovna. " </span><span id="en26406">They must to Siberia be sent!  </span><span id="en26408">Away!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26411">Exclamations arose on all sides.  </span><span id="en26413">Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.  </span><span id="en26415">Sonia stood still, as though unconscious.  </span><span id="en26417">She was hardly able to feel surprise.  </span><span id="en26419">Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry and hid her face in her hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26422">"No, it wasn't I!  </span><span id="en26424">I didn't take it!  </span><span id="en26426">I know nothing about it," she cried with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the world. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26429">"Sonia!  </span><span id="en26431">Sonia!  </span><span id="en26433">I don't believe it!  </span><span id="en26435">You see, I don't believe it!"  </span><span id="en26437">she cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her hands and kissing them, too, "you took it!  </span><span id="en26439">How stupid these people are!  </span><span id="en26441">Oh dear!  </span><span id="en26443">You are fools, fools," she cried, addressing the whole room, "you don't know, you don't know what a heart she has, what a girl she is!  </span><span id="en26445">She take it, she?  </span><span id="en26447">She'd sell her last rag, she'd go barefoot to help you if you needed it, that's what she is!  </span><span id="en26449">She has the yellow passport because my children were starving, she sold herself for us!  </span><span id="en26451">Ah, husband, husband!  </span><span id="en26453">Do you see?  </span><span id="en26455">Do you see?  </span><span id="en26457">What a memorial dinner for you!  </span><span id="en26459">Merciful heavens!  </span><span id="en26461">Defend her, why are you all standing still?  </span><span id="en26463">Rodion Romanovitch, why don't you stand up for her?  </span><span id="en26465">Do you believe it, too?  </span><span id="en26467">You are not worth her little finger, all of you together!  </span><span id="en26469">Good God!  </span><span id="en26471">Defend her now, at least!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26474">The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a great effect on her audience.  </span><span id="en26476">The agonised, wasted, consumptive face, the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained as a child's, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her.  </span><span id="en26477">Pyotr Petrovitch at any rate was at once moved to  </span><i><span id="en26478">compassion </span></i><span id="en26479">. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26482">"Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!"  </span><span id="en26484">he cried impressively, "no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous idea of it.  </span><span id="en26486">I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty, so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to confess, mademoiselle?  </span><span id="en26488">Were you afraid of the disgrace?  </span><span id="en26490">The first step?  </span><span id="en26492">You lost your head, perhaps?  </span><span id="en26494">One can quite understand it....  </span><span id="en26496">But how could you have lowered yourself to such an action?  </span><span id="en26498">Gentlemen," he addressed the whole company, "gentlemen!  </span><span id="en26500">Compassionate and, so to say, commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me!  </span><span id="en26502">And may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future," he said, addressing Sonia, "and I will carry the matter no further.  </span><span id="en26504">Enough!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26507">Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en26509">Their eyes met, and the fire in Raskolnikov's seemed ready to reduce him to ashes.  </span><span id="en26511">Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing.  </span><span id="en26513">She was kissing and hugging Sonia like a madwoman.  </span><span id="en26515">The children, too, were embracing Sonia on all sides, and Polenka—though she did not fully understand what was wrong—was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty little face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia's shoulder. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26518">"How vile!"  </span><span id="en26520">a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26523">Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26526">"What vileness!"  </span><span id="en26528">Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26531">Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start—all noticed it and recalled it afterwards.  </span><span id="en26533">Lebeziatnikov strode into the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26536">"And you dared to call me as witness?"  </span><span id="en26538">he said, going up to Pyotr Petrovitch. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26541">"What do you mean?  </span><span id="en26543">What are you talking about?"  </span><span id="en26545">muttered Luzhin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26548">"I mean that you...  </span><span id="en26550">are a slanderer, that's what my words mean!"  </span><span id="en26552">Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26555">He was extremely angry.  </span><span id="en26557">Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though seizing and weighing each word.  </span><span id="en26559">Again there was a silence.  </span><span id="en26561">Pyotr Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26564">"If you mean that for me,..."  </span><span id="en26566">he began, stammering. " </span><span id="en26568">But what's the matter with you?  </span><span id="en26570">Are you out of your mind?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26573">"I'm in my mind, but you are a scoundrel!  </span><span id="en26575">Ah, how vile!  </span><span id="en26577">I have heard everything.  </span><span id="en26579">I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own even now it is not quite logical....  </span><span id="en26581">What you have done it all for I can't understand." </span></p>
<p><span id="en26584">"Why, what have I done then?  </span><span id="en26586">Give over talking in your nonsensical riddles!  </span><span id="en26588">Or maybe you are drunk!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26591">"You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not!  </span><span id="en26593">I never touch vodka, for it's against my convictions.  </span><span id="en26595">Would you believe it, he, he himself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble note—I saw it, I was a witness, I'll take my oath!  </span><span id="en26597">He did it, he!"  </span><span id="en26599">repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26602">"Are you crazy, milksop?"  </span><span id="en26604">squealed Luzhin. " </span><span id="en26606">She is herself before you—she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her only ten roubles.  </span><span id="en26608">How could I have given it to her?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26611">"I saw it, I saw it," Lebeziatnikov repeated, "and though it is against my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket.  </span><span id="en26613">Only like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness!  </span><span id="en26615">When you were saying good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket.  </span><span id="en26617">I saw it, I saw it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26620">Luzhin turned pale. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26623">"What lies!"  </span><span id="en26625">he cried impudently, "why, how could you, standing by the window, see the note?  </span><span id="en26627">You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes.  </span><span id="en26629">You are raving!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26632">"No, I didn't fancy it.  </span><span id="en26634">And though I was standing some way off, I saw it all.  </span><span id="en26636">And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from the window—that's true—I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles, you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not forget you had it in your hand).  </span><span id="en26638">You folded it and kept it in your hand all the time.  </span><span id="en26640">I didn't think of it again until, when you were getting up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it!  </span><span id="en26642">I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant to do her a kindness without my seeing.  </span><span id="en26644">You can fancy how I watched you and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket.  </span><span id="en26646">I saw it, I saw it, I'll take my oath." </span></p>
<p><span id="en26649">Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless.  </span><span id="en26651">Exclamations arose on all hands chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone.  </span><span id="en26653">They all crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en26655">Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26658">"I was mistaken in you!  </span><span id="en26660">Protect her!  </span><span id="en26662">You are the only one to take her part!  </span><span id="en26664">She is an orphan.  </span><span id="en26666">God has sent you!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26669">Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees before him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26672">"A pack of nonsense!"  </span><span id="en26674">yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, "it's all nonsense you've been talking!  </span><span id="en26676">'An idea struck you, you didn't think, you noticed'—what does it amount to?  </span><span id="en26678">So I gave it to her on the sly on purpose?  </span><span id="en26680">What for?  </span><span id="en26682">With what object?  </span><span id="en26684">What have I to do with this...?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26687">"What for?  </span><span id="en26689">That's what I can't understand, but that what I am telling you is the fact, that's certain!  </span><span id="en26691">So far from my being mistaken, you infamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing your hand.  </span><span id="en26693">What made you put it secretly in her pocket?  </span><span id="en26695">Why you did it secretly, I mean?  </span><span id="en26697">Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private benevolence, which effects no radical cure?  </span><span id="en26699">Well, I decided that you really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me.  </span><span id="en26701">Perhaps, too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket.  </span><span id="en26703">(For I know, some benevolent people are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way. </span><span id="en26705">) Then the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether, when she found it, she would come to thank you.  </span><span id="en26707">Then, too, that you wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand should not know...  </span><span id="en26709">something of that sort, in fact.  </span><span id="en26711">I thought of so many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it indelicate to show you that I knew your secret.  </span><span id="en26713">But another idea struck me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.  </span><span id="en26715">But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov's to take them the 'General Treatise on the Positive Method' and especially to recommend Piderit's article (and also Wagner's); then I come on here and what a state of things I find!  </span><span id="en26717">Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her pocket?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26720">When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical deduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed from his face.  </span><span id="en26722">He could not, alas, even express himself correctly in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit.  </span><span id="en26724">But his speech produced a powerful effect.  </span><span id="en26726">He had spoken with such vehemence, with such conviction that everyone obviously believed him.  </span><span id="en26728">Pyotr Petrovitch felt that things were going badly with him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26731">"What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?"  </span><span id="en26733">he shouted, "that's no evidence.  </span><span id="en26735">You may have dreamt it, that's all!  </span><span id="en26737">And I tell you, you are lying, sir.  </span><span id="en26739">You are lying and slandering from some spite against me, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking, godless, social propositions!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26742">But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en26744">Murmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26747">"Ah, that's your line now, is it!"  </span><span id="en26749">cried Lebeziatnikov, "that's nonsense!  </span><span id="en26751">Call the police and I'll take my oath!  </span><span id="en26753">There's only one thing I can't understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action.  </span><span id="en26755">Oh, pitiful, despicable man!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26758">"I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too, will swear to it," Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he stepped forward. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26761">He appeared to be firm and composed.  </span><span id="en26763">Everyone felt clearly, from the very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would be solved. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26766">"Now I can explain it all to myself," said Raskolnikov, addressing Lebeziatnikov. " </span><span id="en26768">From the very beginning of the business, I suspected that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it.  </span><span id="en26770">I began to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything.  </span><span id="en26772">Your valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me.  </span><span id="en26774">I beg all, all to listen.  </span><span id="en26776">This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently engaged to be married to a young lady—my sister, Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en26778">But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day before yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room—I have two witnesses to prove it.  </span><span id="en26780">He is a very spiteful man....  </span><span id="en26782">The day before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room, and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled—the day before yesterday—he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral, as a friend of the late Mr.  </span><span id="en26784">Marmeladov.  </span><span id="en26786">He at once wrote a note to my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most contemptible way to the...  </span><span id="en26788">character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna.  </span><span id="en26790">All this you understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister, by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money which they had sent me and which was all they had.  </span><span id="en26792">Yesterday evening, before my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had never seen her before, indeed.  </span><span id="en26794">At the same time I added that he, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya Semyonovna's little finger, though he spoke so ill of her.  </span><span id="en26796">To his question—would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I answered that I had already done so that day.  </span><span id="en26798">Irritated that my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he gradually began being unpardonably rude to them.  </span><span id="en26800">A final rupture took place and he was turned out of the house.  </span><span id="en26802">All this happened yesterday evening.  </span><span id="en26804">Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed.  </span><span id="en26806">In fact he might even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family, and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to me.  </span><span id="en26808">That was what he was working for!  </span><span id="en26810">That's how I understand it.  </span><span id="en26812">That's the whole reason for it and there can be no other!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26815">It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by exclamations from his audience.  </span><span id="en26817">But in spite of interruptions he spoke clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly.  </span><span id="en26819">His decisive voice, his tone of conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26822">"Yes, yes, that's it," Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, "that must be it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room, whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna's guests.  </span><span id="en26824">He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret.  </span><span id="en26826">It was essential for him that you should be here!  </span><span id="en26828">That's it, that's it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26831">Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak.  </span><span id="en26833">But he was very pale.  </span><span id="en26835">He seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape.  </span><span id="en26837">Perhaps he would have been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this was scarcely possible.  </span><span id="en26839">It would have implied admitting the truth of the accusations brought against him.  </span><span id="en26841">Moreover, the company, which had already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it.  </span><span id="en26843">The commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position, was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very unpleasant to Luzhin.  </span><span id="en26845">But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came in from all the rooms.  </span><span id="en26846">The three Poles were tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him: "The  </span><i><span id="en26847">pan </span></i><span id="en26848"> is a  </span><i><span id="en26849">lajdak </span></i><span id="en26851">!" and muttering threats in Polish.  </span><span id="en26853">Sonia had been listening with strained attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as though she had just returned to consciousness.  </span><span id="en26855">She did not take her eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him.  </span><span id="en26857">Katerina Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.  </span><span id="en26859">Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth wide open, unable to make out what had happened.  </span><span id="en26861">She only saw that Pyotr Petrovitch had somehow come to grief. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26866">Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.  </span><span id="en26868">Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.  </span><span id="en26870">But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated.  </span><span id="en26871">Seeing that his accusation of Sonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence: </span></p>
<p><span id="en26873">"Allow me, gentlemen, allow me!  </span><span id="en26875">Don't squeeze, let me pass!"  </span><span id="en26877">he said, making his way through the crowd. " </span><span id="en26879">And no threats, if you please!  </span><span id="en26881">I assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it.  </span><span id="en26883">On the contrary, you'll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing the course of justice.  </span><span id="en26885">The thief has been more than unmasked, and I shall prosecute.  </span><span id="en26887">Our judges are not so blind and...  </span><span id="en26889">not so drunk, and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit....  </span><span id="en26891">Yes, allow me to pass!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26894">"Don't let me find a trace of you in my room!  </span><span id="en26896">Kindly leave at once, and everything is at an end between us!  </span><span id="en26898">When I think of the trouble I've been taking, the way I've been expounding...  </span><span id="en26900">all this fortnight!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26903">"I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me; now I will simply add that you are a fool.  </span><span id="en26905">I advise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight.  </span><span id="en26907">Let me pass, gentlemen!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26910">He forced his way through.  </span><span id="en26912">But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew straight at Amalia Ivanovna.  </span><span id="en26914">She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing, fell heavily under the table.  </span><span id="en26916">Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room and half an hour later had left the house.  </span><span id="en26918">Sonia, timid by nature, had felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity.  </span><span id="en26920">Yet till that moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care, gentleness and submissiveness before everyone.  </span><span id="en26922">Her disappointment was too great.  </span><span id="en26924">She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without murmur anything, even this.  </span><span id="en26926">But for the first minute she felt it too bitter.  </span><span id="en26928">In spite of her triumph and her justification—when her first terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all clearly—the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical weeping.  </span><span id="en26930">At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin's departure.  </span><span id="en26932">When amidst loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the landlady could endure.  </span><span id="en26934">With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina Ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26937">"Out of my lodgings!  </span><span id="en26939">At once!  </span><span id="en26941">Quick march!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26944">And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the floor.  </span><span id="en26946">Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath, jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at Amalia Ivanovna.  </span><span id="en26948">But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her away like a feather. </span></p>
<p><span id="en26951">"What!  </span><span id="en26953">As though that godless calumny was not enough—this vile creature attacks me!  </span><span id="en26955">What!  </span><span id="en26957">On the day of my husband's funeral I am turned out of my lodging!  </span><span id="en26959">After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street, with my orphans!  </span><span id="en26961">Where am I to go?"  </span><span id="en26963">wailed the poor woman, sobbing and gasping. " </span><span id="en26965">Good God!"  </span><span id="en26967">she cried with flashing eyes, "is there no justice upon earth?  </span><span id="en26969">Whom should you protect if not us orphans?  </span><span id="en26971">We shall see!  </span><span id="en26973">There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it!  </span><span id="en26975">Wait a bit, godless creature!  </span><span id="en26977">Polenka, stay with the children, I'll come back.  </span><span id="en26979">Wait for me, if you have to wait in the street.  </span><span id="en26981">We will see whether there is justice on earth!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26984">And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and, wailing and tearful, she ran into the street—with a vague intention of going at once somewhere to find justice.  </span><span id="en26986">Polenka with the two little ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back.  </span><span id="en26988">Amalia Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing everything she came across on the floor.  </span><span id="en26990">The lodgers talked incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others struck up a song.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en26993">"Now it's time for me to go," thought Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en26995">Well, Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en26998">And he set off in the direction of Sonia's lodgings. </span></p>

<p><span id="en27002">Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own heart.  </span><span id="en27004">But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia.  </span><span id="en27005">He was agitated too, especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview with Sonia: he  </span><i><span id="en27006">had </span></i><span id="en27007">  </span><span id="en27008">to tell her who had killed Lizaveta.  </span><span id="en27010">He knew the terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the thought of it.  </span><span id="en27012">So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna's, "Well, Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!"  </span><span id="en27014">he was still superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over Luzhin.  </span><span id="en27016">But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia's lodging, he felt a sudden impotence and fear.  </span><span id="en27018">He stood still in hesitation at the door, asking himself the strange question: "Must he tell her who killed Lizaveta?"  </span><span id="en27020">It was a strange question because he felt at the very time not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could not put off the telling.  </span><span id="en27021">He did not yet know why it must be so, he only  </span><i><span id="en27022">felt </span></i><span id="en27023">  </span><span id="en27024">it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before the inevitable almost crushed him.  </span><span id="en27026">To cut short his hesitation and suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the doorway.  </span><span id="en27028">She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him as though she were expecting him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27033">"What would have become of me but for you?"  </span><span id="en27035">she said quickly, meeting him in the middle of the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27038">Evidently she was in haste to say this to him.  </span><span id="en27040">It was what she had been waiting for. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27043">Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had only just risen.  </span><span id="en27045">She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she had done the day before. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27048">"Well, Sonia?"  </span><span id="en27050">he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, "it was all due to 'your social position and the habits associated with it. </span><span id="en27052">' Did you understand that just now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27055">Her face showed her distress. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27058">"Only don't talk to me as you did yesterday," she interrupted him. " </span><span id="en27060">Please don't begin it.  </span><span id="en27062">There is misery enough without that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27065">She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27068">"I was silly to come away from there.  </span><span id="en27070">What is happening there now?  </span><span id="en27072">I wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that...  </span><span id="en27074">you would come." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27077">He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere "to seek justice." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27080">"My God!"  </span><span id="en27082">cried Sonia, "let's go at once...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27085">And she snatched up her cape. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27088">"It's everlastingly the same thing!"  </span><span id="en27090">said Raskolnikov, irritably. " </span><span id="en27092">You've no thought except for them!  </span><span id="en27094">Stay a little with me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27097">"But...  </span><span id="en27099">Katerina Ivanovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27102">"You won't lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she'll come to you herself since she has run out," he added peevishly. " </span><span id="en27104">If she doesn't find you here, you'll be blamed for it...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27107">Sonia sat down in painful suspense.  </span><span id="en27109">Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at the floor and deliberating. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27112">"This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you," he began, not looking at Sonia, "but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.  </span><span id="en27114">Ah?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27117">"Yes," she assented in a faint voice. " </span><span id="en27119">Yes," she repeated, preoccupied and distressed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27122">"But I might easily not have been there.  </span><span id="en27124">And it was quite an accident Lebeziatnikov's turning up." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27127">Sonia was silent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27130">"And if you'd gone to prison, what then?  </span><span id="en27132">Do you remember what I said yesterday?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27135">Again she did not answer.  </span><span id="en27137">He waited. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27140">"I thought you would cry out again 'don't speak of it, leave off. </span><span id="en27142">'" Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. " </span><span id="en27144">What, silence again?"  </span><span id="en27146">he asked a minute later. " </span><span id="en27148">We must talk about something, you know.  </span><span id="en27150">It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a certain 'problem' as Lebeziatnikov would say."  </span><span id="en27152">(He was beginning to lose the thread. </span><span id="en27154">) "No, really, I am serious.  </span><span id="en27156">Imagine, Sonia, that you had known all Luzhin's intentions beforehand.  </span><span id="en27158">Known, that is, for a fact, that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and yourself thrown in—since you don't count yourself for anything—Polenka too...  </span><span id="en27160">for she'll go the same way.  </span><span id="en27162">Well, if suddenly it all depended on your decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna should die?  </span><span id="en27164">How would you decide which of them was to die?  </span><span id="en27166">I ask you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27169">Sonia looked uneasily at him.  </span><span id="en27171">There was something peculiar in this hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout way. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27174">"I felt that you were going to ask some question like that," she said, looking inquisitively at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27177">"I dare say you did.  </span><span id="en27179">But how is it to be answered?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27182">"Why do you ask about what could not happen?"  </span><span id="en27184">said Sonia reluctantly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27187">"Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked things?  </span><span id="en27189">You haven't dared to decide even that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27192">"But I can't know the Divine Providence....  </span><span id="en27194">And why do you ask what can't be answered?  </span><span id="en27196">What's the use of such foolish questions?  </span><span id="en27198">How could it happen that it should depend on my decision—who has made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27201">"Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing anything," Raskolnikov grumbled morosely. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27204">"You'd better say straight out what you want!"  </span><span id="en27206">Sonia cried in distress. " </span><span id="en27208">You are leading up to something again....  </span><span id="en27210">Can you have come simply to torture me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27213">She could not control herself and began crying bitterly.  </span><span id="en27215">He looked at her in gloomy misery.  </span><span id="en27217">Five minutes passed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27220">"Of course you're right, Sonia," he said softly at last.  </span><span id="en27222">He was suddenly changed.  </span><span id="en27224">His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.  </span><span id="en27226">Even his voice was suddenly weak. " </span><span id="en27228">I told you yesterday that I was not coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I've said is to ask forgiveness....  </span><span id="en27230">I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.  </span><span id="en27232">I was asking forgiveness, Sonia...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27235">He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in his pale smile.  </span><span id="en27237">He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27240">And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred for Sonia passed through his heart.  </span><span id="en27242">As it were wondering and frightened of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom.  </span><span id="en27244">It was not the real feeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other.  </span><span id="en27245">It only meant that  </span><i><span id="en27246">that </span></i><span id="en27247">  </span><span id="en27248">minute had come. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27252">He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head.  </span><span id="en27254">Suddenly he turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27257">His sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that "he must not lose another minute." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27260">"What's the matter?"  </span><span id="en27262">asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27265">He could not utter a word.  </span><span id="en27267">This was not at all, not at all the way he had intended to "tell" and he did not understand what was happening to him now.  </span><span id="en27269">She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and waited, not taking her eyes off him.  </span><span id="en27271">Her heart throbbed and sank.  </span><span id="en27273">It was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her.  </span><span id="en27275">His lips worked, helplessly struggling to utter something.  </span><span id="en27277">A pang of terror passed through Sonia's heart. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27280">"What's the matter?"  </span><span id="en27282">she repeated, drawing a little away from him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27285">"Nothing, Sonia, don't be frightened....  </span><span id="en27287">It's nonsense.  </span><span id="en27289">It really is nonsense, if you think of it," he muttered, like a man in delirium. " </span><span id="en27291">Why have I come to torture you?"  </span><span id="en27293">he added suddenly, looking at her. " </span><span id="en27295">Why, really?  </span><span id="en27297">I keep asking myself that question, Sonia...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27300">He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor all over. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27303">"Oh, how you are suffering!"  </span><span id="en27305">she muttered in distress, looking intently at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27308">"It's all nonsense....  </span><span id="en27310">Listen, Sonia."  </span><span id="en27312">He suddenly smiled, a pale helpless smile for two seconds. " </span><span id="en27314">You remember what I meant to tell you yesterday?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27317">Sonia waited uneasily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27320">"I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but that if I came to-day I would tell you who...  </span><span id="en27322">who killed Lizaveta." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27325">She began trembling all over. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27328">"Well, here I've come to tell you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27331">"Then you really meant it yesterday?"  </span><span id="en27333">she whispered with difficulty. " </span><span id="en27335">How do you know?"  </span><span id="en27337">she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her reason. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27340">Sonia's face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27343">"I know." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27346">She paused a minute. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27349">"Have they found him?"  </span><span id="en27351">she asked timidly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27354">"No." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27356">"Then how do you know about  </span><i><span id="en27357">it </span></i><span id="en27359">?" she asked again, hardly audibly and again after a minute's pause. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27363">He turned to her and looked very intently at her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27366">"Guess," he said, with the same distorted helpless smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27369">A shudder passed over her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27372">"But you...  </span><span id="en27374">why do you frighten me like this?"  </span><span id="en27376">she said, smiling like a child. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27378">"I must be a great friend of  </span><i><span id="en27379">his </span></i><span id="en27381">...  </span><span id="en27383">since I know," Raskolnikov went on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes away. " </span><span id="en27385">He...  </span><span id="en27387">did not mean to kill that Lizaveta...  </span><span id="en27389">he...  </span><span id="en27391">killed her accidentally....  </span><span id="en27393">He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and he went there...  </span><span id="en27395">and then Lizaveta came in...  </span><span id="en27397">he killed her too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27401">Another awful moment passed.  </span><span id="en27403">Both still gazed at one another. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27406">"You can't guess, then?"  </span><span id="en27408">he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were flinging himself down from a steeple. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27411">"N-no..."  </span><span id="en27413">whispered Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27416">"Take a good look." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27419">As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his heart.  </span><span id="en27421">He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the face of Lizaveta.  </span><span id="en27423">He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta's face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something, looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and holding out their little hands on the point of crying.  </span><span id="en27425">Almost the same thing happened now to Sonia.  </span><span id="en27427">With the same helplessness and the same terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more immovably on him.  </span><span id="en27429">Her terror infected him.  </span><span id="en27431">The same fear showed itself on his face.  </span><span id="en27432">In the same way he stared at her and almost with the same  </span><i><span id="en27433">childish </span></i><span id="en27434">  </span><span id="en27435">smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27439">"Have you guessed?"  </span><span id="en27441">he whispered at last. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27444">"Good God!"  </span><span id="en27446">broke in an awful wail from her bosom. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27449">She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his face again with the same intent stare.  </span><span id="en27451">In this last desperate look she tried to look into him and catch some last hope.  </span><span id="en27453">But there was no hope; there was no doubt remaining; it was all true!  </span><span id="en27455">Later on, indeed, when she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she had seen at once that there was no doubt.  </span><span id="en27457">She could not have said, for instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort—and yet now, as soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very thing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27460">"Stop, Sonia, enough!  </span><span id="en27462">don't torture me," he begged her miserably. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27465">It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her, but this is how it happened. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27468">She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his.  </span><span id="en27470">All of a sudden she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on her knees before him, she did not know why. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27473">"What have you done—what have you done to yourself?"  </span><span id="en27475">she said in despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms round him, and held him tightly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27478">Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27481">"You are a strange girl, Sonia—you kiss me and hug me when I tell you about that....  </span><span id="en27483">You don't think what you are doing." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27486">"There is no one—no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!"  </span><span id="en27488">she cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weeping. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27491">A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at once.  </span><span id="en27493">He did not struggle against it.  </span><span id="en27495">Two tears started into his eyes and hung on his eyelashes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27498">"Then you won't leave me, Sonia?"  </span><span id="en27500">he said, looking at her almost with hope. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27503">"No, no, never, nowhere!"  </span><span id="en27505">cried Sonia. " </span><span id="en27507">I will follow you, I will follow you everywhere.  </span><span id="en27509">Oh, my God!  </span><span id="en27511">Oh, how miserable I am!...  </span><span id="en27513">Why, why didn't I know you before!  </span><span id="en27515">Why didn't you come before?  </span><span id="en27517">Oh, dear!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27520">"Here I have come." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27523">"Yes, now!  </span><span id="en27525">What's to be done now?...  </span><span id="en27527">Together, together!"  </span><span id="en27529">she repeated as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. " </span><span id="en27531">I'll follow you to Siberia!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27534">He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to his lips. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27537">"Perhaps I don't want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia," he said. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27540">Sonia looked at him quickly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27543">Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her.  </span><span id="en27545">In his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking.  </span><span id="en27547">She looked at him bewildered.  </span><span id="en27549">She knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been.  </span><span id="en27551">Now all these questions rushed at once into her mind.  </span><span id="en27553">And again she could not believe it: "He, he is a murderer!  </span><span id="en27555">Could it be true?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27558">"What's the meaning of it?  </span><span id="en27560">Where am I?"  </span><span id="en27562">she said in complete bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. " </span><span id="en27564">How could you, you, a man like you....  </span><span id="en27566">How could you bring yourself to it?...  </span><span id="en27568">What does it mean?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27571">"Oh, well—to plunder.  </span><span id="en27573">Leave off, Sonia," he answered wearily, almost with vexation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27575">Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried: </span></p>
<p><span id="en27577">"You were hungry!  </span><span id="en27579">It was...  </span><span id="en27581">to help your mother?  </span><span id="en27583">Yes?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27586">"No, Sonia, no," he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. " </span><span id="en27588">I was not so hungry....  </span><span id="en27590">I certainly did want to help my mother, but...  </span><span id="en27592">that's not the real thing either....  </span><span id="en27594">Don't torture me, Sonia." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27597">Sonia clasped her hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27600">"Could it, could it all be true?  </span><span id="en27602">Good God, what a truth!  </span><span id="en27604">Who could believe it?  </span><span id="en27606">And how could you give away your last farthing and yet rob and murder!  </span><span id="en27608">Ah," she cried suddenly, "that money you gave Katerina Ivanovna...  </span><span id="en27610">that money....  </span><span id="en27612">Can that money..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27615">"No, Sonia," he broke in hurriedly, "that money was not it.  </span><span id="en27617">Don't worry yourself!  </span><span id="en27619">That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the day I gave it to you....  </span><span id="en27621">Razumihin saw it...  </span><span id="en27623">he received it for me....  </span><span id="en27625">That money was mine—my own." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27628">Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27630">"And  </span><i><span id="en27631">that </span></i><span id="en27632">  </span><span id="en27633">money....  </span><span id="en27635">I don't even know really whether there was any money," he added softly, as though reflecting. " </span><span id="en27637">I took a purse off her neck, made of chamois leather...  </span><span id="en27639">a purse stuffed full of something...  </span><span id="en27641">but I didn't look in it; I suppose I hadn't time....  </span><span id="en27643">And the things—chains and trinkets—I buried under a stone with the purse next morning in a yard off the V—— Prospect.  </span><span id="en27645">They are all there now...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27649">Sonia strained every nerve to listen. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27652">"Then why...  </span><span id="en27654">why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?"  </span><span id="en27656">she asked quickly, catching at a straw. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27659">"I don't know....  </span><span id="en27661">I haven't yet decided whether to take that money or not," he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he gave a brief ironical smile. " </span><span id="en27663">Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27666">The thought flashed through Sonia's mind, wasn't he mad?  </span><span id="en27668">But she dismissed it at once. " </span><span id="en27670">No, it was something else."  </span><span id="en27672">She could make nothing of it, nothing. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27674">"Do you know, Sonia," he said suddenly with conviction, "let me tell you: if I'd simply killed because I was hungry," laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, "I should be  </span><i><span id="en27675">happy </span></i><span id="en27676">  </span><span id="en27677">now.  </span><span id="en27679">You must believe that!  </span><span id="en27681">What would it matter to you," he cried a moment later with a sort of despair, "what would it matter to you if I were to confess that I did wrong?  </span><span id="en27683">What do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me?  </span><span id="en27685">Ah, Sonia, was it for that I've come to you to-day?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27689">Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27692">"I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27695">"Go where?"  </span><span id="en27697">asked Sonia timidly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27700">"Not to steal and not to murder, don't be anxious," he smiled bitterly. " </span><span id="en27702">We are so different....  </span><span id="en27703">And you know, Sonia, it's only now, only this moment that I understand  </span><i><span id="en27704">where </span></i><span id="en27705">  </span><span id="en27706">I asked you to go with me yesterday!  </span><span id="en27708">Yesterday when I said it I did not know where.  </span><span id="en27710">I asked you for one thing, I came to you for one thing—not to leave me.  </span><span id="en27712">You won't leave me, Sonia?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27716">She squeezed his hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27719">"And why, why did I tell her?  </span><span id="en27721">Why did I let her know?"  </span><span id="en27723">he cried a minute later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. " </span><span id="en27725">Here you expect an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see that.  </span><span id="en27727">But what can I tell you?  </span><span id="en27729">You won't understand and will only suffer misery...  </span><span id="en27731">on my account!  </span><span id="en27733">Well, you are crying and embracing me again.  </span><span id="en27735">Why do you do it?  </span><span id="en27737">Because I couldn't bear my burden and have come to throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better!  </span><span id="en27739">And can you love such a mean wretch?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27742">"But aren't you suffering, too?"  </span><span id="en27744">cried Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27747">Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an instant softened it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27750">"Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that.  </span><span id="en27752">It may explain a great deal.  </span><span id="en27754">I have come because I am bad.  </span><span id="en27756">There are men who wouldn't have come.  </span><span id="en27758">But I am a coward and...  </span><span id="en27760">a mean wretch.  </span><span id="en27762">But...  </span><span id="en27764">never mind!  </span><span id="en27766">That's not the point.  </span><span id="en27768">I must speak now, but I don't know how to begin." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27771">He paused and sank into thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27774">"Ach, we are so different," he cried again, "we are not alike.  </span><span id="en27776">And why, why did I come?  </span><span id="en27778">I shall never forgive myself that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27781">"No, no, it was a good thing you came," cried Sonia. " </span><span id="en27783">It's better I should know, far better!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27786">He looked at her with anguish. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27789">"What if it were really that?"  </span><span id="en27791">he said, as though reaching a conclusion. " </span><span id="en27793">Yes, that's what it was!  </span><span id="en27795">I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I killed her....  </span><span id="en27797">Do you understand now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27800">"N-no," Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. " </span><span id="en27801">Only speak, speak, I shall understand, I shall understand  </span><i><span id="en27802">in myself </span></i><span id="en27804">!" she kept begging him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27808">"You'll understand?  </span><span id="en27810">Very well, we shall see!"  </span><span id="en27812">He paused and was for some time lost in meditation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27815">"It was like this: I asked myself one day this question—what if Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things, there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you understand).  </span><span id="en27817">Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had been no other means?  </span><span id="en27819">Wouldn't he have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental and...  </span><span id="en27821">and sinful, too?  </span><span id="en27823">Well, I must tell you that I worried myself fearfully over that 'question' so that I was awfully ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would not have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck him that it was not monumental...  </span><span id="en27825">that he would not have seen that there was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way, he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!  </span><span id="en27827">Well, I too...  </span><span id="en27829">left off thinking about it...  </span><span id="en27831">murdered her, following his example.  </span><span id="en27833">And that's exactly how it was!  </span><span id="en27835">Do you think it funny?  </span><span id="en27837">Yes, Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that's just how it was." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27840">Sonia did not think it at all funny. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27843">"You had better tell me straight out...  </span><span id="en27845">without examples," she begged, still more timidly and scarcely audibly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27848">He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27851">"You are right again, Sonia.  </span><span id="en27853">Of course that's all nonsense, it's almost all talk!  </span><span id="en27855">You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned to drudge as a governess.  </span><span id="en27857">All their hopes were centered on me.  </span><span id="en27859">I was a student, but I couldn't keep myself at the university and was forced for a time to leave it.  </span><span id="en27861">Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles" (he repeated it as though it were a lesson) "and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my sister...  </span><span id="en27863">well, my sister might well have fared worse!  </span><span id="en27865">And it's a hard thing to pass everything by all one's life, to turn one's back upon everything, to forget one's mother and decorously accept the insults inflicted on one's sister.  </span><span id="en27867">Why should one?  </span><span id="en27869">When one has buried them to burden oneself with others—wife and children—and to leave them again without a farthing?  </span><span id="en27871">So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman's money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother, to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving it—and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....  </span><span id="en27873">Well...  </span><span id="en27875">that's all....  </span><span id="en27877">Well, of course in killing the old woman I did wrong....  </span><span id="en27879">Well, that's enough." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27882">He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head sink. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27885">"Oh, that's not it, that's not it," Sonia cried in distress. " </span><span id="en27887">How could one...  </span><span id="en27889">no, that's not right, not right." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27892">"You see yourself that it's not right.  </span><span id="en27894">But I've spoken truly, it's the truth." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27897">"As though that could be the truth!  </span><span id="en27899">Good God!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27902">"I've only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful creature." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27905">"A human being—a louse!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en27908">"I too know it wasn't a louse," he answered, looking strangely at her. " </span><span id="en27910">But I am talking nonsense, Sonia," he added. " </span><span id="en27912">I've been talking nonsense a long time....  </span><span id="en27914">That's not it, you are right there.  </span><span id="en27916">There were quite, quite other causes for it!  </span><span id="en27918">I haven't talked to anyone for so long, Sonia....  </span><span id="en27920">My head aches dreadfully now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en27923">His eyes shone with feverish brilliance.  </span><span id="en27925">He was almost delirious; an uneasy smile strayed on his lips.  </span><span id="en27927">His terrible exhaustion could be seen through his excitement.  </span><span id="en27929">Sonia saw how he was suffering.  </span><span id="en27931">She too was growing dizzy.  </span><span id="en27933">And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow comprehensible, but yet... " </span><span id="en27935">But how, how!  </span><span id="en27937">Good God!"  </span><span id="en27939">And she wrung her hands in despair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en27942">"No, Sonia, that's not it," he began again suddenly, raising his head, as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were roused him—"that's not it!  </span><span id="en27944">Better...  </span><span id="en27946">imagine—yes, it's certainly better—imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive and...  </span><span id="en27948">well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity.  </span><span id="en27950">(Let's have it all out at once!  </span><span id="en27952">They've talked of madness already, I noticed. </span><span id="en27954">) I told you just now I could not keep myself at the university.  </span><span id="en27956">But do you know that perhaps I might have done?  </span><span id="en27958">My mother would have sent me what I needed for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food, no doubt.  </span><span id="en27960">Lessons had turned up at half a rouble.  </span><span id="en27962">Razumihin works!  </span><span id="en27964">But I turned sulky and wouldn't.  </span><span id="en27966">(Yes, sulkiness, that's the right word for it! </span><span id="en27968">) I sat in my room like a spider.  </span><span id="en27970">You've been in my den, you've seen it....  </span><span id="en27972">And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind?  </span><span id="en27974">Ah, how I hated that garret!  </span><span id="en27976">And yet I wouldn't go out of it!  </span><span id="en27978">I wouldn't on purpose!  </span><span id="en27980">I didn't go out for days together, and I wouldn't work, I wouldn't even eat, I just lay there doing nothing.  </span><span id="en27982">If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn't, I went all day without; I wouldn't ask, on purpose, from sulkiness!  </span><span id="en27984">At night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn't earn money for candles.  </span><span id="en27986">I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies an inch thick on the notebooks on my table.  </span><span id="en27988">I preferred lying still and thinking.  </span><span id="en27990">And I kept thinking....  </span><span id="en27992">And I had dreams all the time, strange dreams of all sorts, no need to describe!  </span><span id="en27994">Only then I began to fancy that...  </span><span id="en27996">No, that's not it!  </span><span id="en27998">Again I am telling you wrong!  </span><span id="en28000">You see I kept asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid—and I know they are—yet I won't be wiser?  </span><span id="en28002">Then I saw, Sonia, that if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long....  </span><span id="en28004">Afterwards I understood that that would never come to pass, that men won't change and that nobody can alter it and that it's not worth wasting effort over it.  </span><span id="en28006">Yes, that's so.  </span><span id="en28008">That's the law of their nature, Sonia,...  </span><span id="en28010">that's so!...  </span><span id="en28012">And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them.  </span><span id="en28014">Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their eyes.  </span><span id="en28016">He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he who dares most of all will be most in the right!  </span><span id="en28018">So it has been till now and so it will always be.  </span><span id="en28020">A man must be blind not to see it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28023">Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared whether she understood or not.  </span><span id="en28025">The fever had complete hold of him; he was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without talking to anyone).  </span><span id="en28027">Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and code. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28030">"I divined then, Sonia," he went on eagerly, "that power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up.  </span><span id="en28032">There is only one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare!  </span><span id="en28034">Then for the first time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever thought of before me, no one!  </span><span id="en28036">I saw clear as daylight how strange it is that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil!  </span><span id="en28038">I...  </span><span id="en28039">I wanted  </span><i><span id="en28040">to have the daring </span></i><span id="en28042">...  </span><span id="en28044">and I killed her.  </span><span id="en28046">I only wanted to have the daring, Sonia!  </span><span id="en28048">That was the whole cause of it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28052">"Oh hush, hush," cried Sonia, clasping her hands. " </span><span id="en28054">You turned away from God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28057">"Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28060">"Hush, don't laugh, blasphemer!  </span><span id="en28062">You don't understand, you don't understand!  </span><span id="en28064">Oh God!  </span><span id="en28066">He won't understand!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28069">"Hush, Sonia!  </span><span id="en28071">I am not laughing.  </span><span id="en28073">I know myself that it was the devil leading me.  </span><span id="en28075">Hush, Sonia, hush!"  </span><span id="en28077">he repeated with gloomy insistence. " </span><span id="en28079">I know it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all over to myself, lying there in the dark....  </span><span id="en28081">I've argued it all over with myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all!  </span><span id="en28083">And how sick, how sick I was then of going over it all!  </span><span id="en28085">I have kept wanting to forget it and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking.  </span><span id="en28087">And you don't suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool?  </span><span id="en28089">I went into it like a wise man, and that was just my destruction.  </span><span id="en28091">And you mustn't suppose that I didn't know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether I had the right to gain power—I certainly hadn't the right—or that if I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn't so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his goal without asking questions....  </span><span id="en28093">If I worried myself all those days, wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly of course that I wasn't Napoleon.  </span><span id="en28095">I had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone!  </span><span id="en28097">I didn't want to lie about it even to myself.  </span><span id="en28099">It wasn't to help my mother I did the murder—that's nonsense—I didn't do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind.  </span><span id="en28101">Nonsense!  </span><span id="en28103">I simply did it; I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn't have cared at that moment....  </span><span id="en28105">And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it.  </span><span id="en28107">It was not so much the money I wanted, but something else....  </span><span id="en28109">I know it all now....  </span><span id="en28111">Understand me!  </span><span id="en28113">Perhaps I should never have committed a murder again.  </span><span id="en28115">I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led me on.  </span><span id="en28117">I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else or a man.  </span><span id="en28118">Whether I can step over barriers or not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling creature or whether I have the  </span><i><span id="en28119">right </span></i><span id="en28121">..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28125">"To kill?  </span><span id="en28127">Have the right to kill?"  </span><span id="en28129">Sonia clasped her hands. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28132">"Ach, Sonia!"  </span><span id="en28134">he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort, but was contemptuously silent. " </span><span id="en28136">Don't interrupt me, Sonia.  </span><span id="en28138">I want to prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such a louse as all the rest.  </span><span id="en28140">He was mocking me and here I've come to you now!  </span><span id="en28142">Welcome your guest!  </span><span id="en28144">If I were not a louse, should I have come to you?  </span><span id="en28145">Listen: when I went then to the old woman's I only went to  </span><i><span id="en28146">try </span></i><span id="en28148">....  </span><span id="en28150">You may be sure of that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28154">"And you murdered her!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28157">"But how did I murder her?  </span><span id="en28159">Is that how men do murders?  </span><span id="en28161">Do men go to commit a murder as I went then?  </span><span id="en28163">I will tell you some day how I went!  </span><span id="en28165">Did I murder the old woman?  </span><span id="en28167">I murdered myself, not her!  </span><span id="en28169">I crushed myself once for all, for ever....  </span><span id="en28171">But it was the devil that killed that old woman, not I.  </span><span id="en28173">Enough, enough, Sonia, enough!  </span><span id="en28175">Let me be!"  </span><span id="en28177">he cried in a sudden spasm of agony, "let me be!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28180">He leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as in a vise. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28183">"What suffering!"  </span><span id="en28185">A wail of anguish broke from Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28188">"Well, what am I to do now?"  </span><span id="en28190">he asked, suddenly raising his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28193">"What are you to do?"  </span><span id="en28195">she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine. " </span><span id="en28197">Stand up!"  </span><span id="en28199">(She seized him by the shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered. </span><span id="en28201">) "Go at once, this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all men aloud, 'I am a murderer! </span><span id="en28203">' Then God will send you life again.  </span><span id="en28205">Will you go, will you go?"  </span><span id="en28207">she asked him, trembling all over, snatching his two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes full of fire. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28210">He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28213">"You mean Siberia, Sonia?  </span><span id="en28215">I must give myself up?"  </span><span id="en28217">he asked gloomily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28220">"Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that's what you must do." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28223">"No!  </span><span id="en28225">I am not going to them, Sonia!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28228">"But how will you go on living?  </span><span id="en28230">What will you live for?"  </span><span id="en28232">cried Sonia, "how is it possible now?  </span><span id="en28234">Why, how can you talk to your mother?  </span><span id="en28236">(Oh, what will become of them now? </span><span id="en28238">) But what am I saying?  </span><span id="en28240">You have abandoned your mother and your sister already.  </span><span id="en28242">He has abandoned them already!  </span><span id="en28244">Oh, God!"  </span><span id="en28246">she cried, "why, he knows it all himself.  </span><span id="en28248">How, how can he live by himself!  </span><span id="en28250">What will become of you now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28253">"Don't be a child, Sonia," he said softly. " </span><span id="en28255">What wrong have I done them?  </span><span id="en28257">Why should I go to them?  </span><span id="en28259">What should I say to them?  </span><span id="en28261">That's only a phantom....  </span><span id="en28263">They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue.  </span><span id="en28265">They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia!  </span><span id="en28267">I am not going to them.  </span><span id="en28269">And what should I say to them—that I murdered her, but did not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone?"  </span><span id="en28271">he added with a bitter smile. " </span><span id="en28273">Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting it.  </span><span id="en28275">A coward and a fool!  </span><span id="en28277">They wouldn't understand and they don't deserve to understand.  </span><span id="en28279">Why should I go to them?  </span><span id="en28281">I won't.  </span><span id="en28283">Don't be a child, Sonia...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28286">"It will be too much for you to bear, too much!"  </span><span id="en28288">she repeated, holding out her hands in despairing supplication. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28291">"Perhaps I've been unfair to myself," he observed gloomily, pondering, "perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I've been in too great a hurry to condemn myself.  </span><span id="en28293">I'll make another fight for it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28296">A haughty smile appeared on his lips. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28299">"What a burden to bear!  </span><span id="en28301">And your whole life, your whole life!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28304">"I shall get used to it," he said grimly and thoughtfully. " </span><span id="en28306">Listen," he began a minute later, "stop crying, it's time to talk of the facts: I've come to tell you that the police are after me, on my track...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28309">"Ach!"  </span><span id="en28311">Sonia cried in terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28314">"Well, why do you cry out?  </span><span id="en28316">You want me to go to Siberia and now you are frightened?  </span><span id="en28318">But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up.  </span><span id="en28320">I shall make a struggle for it and they won't do anything to me.  </span><span id="en28322">They've no real evidence.  </span><span id="en28324">Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but to-day things are going better.  </span><span id="en28326">All the facts they know can be explained two ways, that's to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do you understand?  </span><span id="en28328">And I shall, for I've learnt my lesson.  </span><span id="en28330">But they will certainly arrest me.  </span><span id="en28332">If it had not been for something that happened, they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will arrest me to-day....  </span><span id="en28334">But that's no matter, Sonia; they'll let me out again...  </span><span id="en28336">for there isn't any real proof against me, and there won't be, I give you my word for it.  </span><span id="en28338">And they can't convict a man on what they have against me.  </span><span id="en28340">Enough....  </span><span id="en28342">I only tell you that you may know....  </span><span id="en28344">I will try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they won't be frightened....  </span><span id="en28346">My sister's future is secure, however, now, I believe...  </span><span id="en28348">and my mother's must be too....  </span><span id="en28350">Well, that's all.  </span><span id="en28352">Be careful, though.  </span><span id="en28354">Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28357">"Oh, I will, I will." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28360">They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore.  </span><span id="en28362">He looked at Sonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved.  </span><span id="en28364">Yes, it was a strange and awful sensation!  </span><span id="en28366">On his way to see Sonia he had felt that all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28369">"Sonia," he said, "you'd better not come and see me when I am in prison." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28372">Sonia did not answer, she was crying.  </span><span id="en28374">Several minutes passed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28377">"Have you a cross on you?"  </span><span id="en28379">she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28382">He did not at first understand the question. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28385">"No, of course not.  </span><span id="en28387">Here, take this one, of cypress wood.  </span><span id="en28389">I have another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta.  </span><span id="en28391">I changed with Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon.  </span><span id="en28393">I will wear Lizaveta's now and give you this.  </span><span id="en28395">Take it...  </span><span id="en28397">it's mine!  </span><span id="en28399">It's mine, you know," she begged him. " </span><span id="en28401">We will go to suffer together, and together we will bear our cross!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28404">"Give it me," said Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28407">He did not want to hurt her feelings.  </span><span id="en28409">But immediately he drew back the hand he held out for the cross. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28412">"Not now, Sonia.  </span><span id="en28414">Better later," he added to comfort her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28417">"Yes, yes, better," she repeated with conviction, "when you go to meet your suffering, then put it on.  </span><span id="en28419">You will come to me, I'll put it on you, we will pray and go together." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28422">At that moment someone knocked three times at the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28425">"Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?"  </span><span id="en28427">they heard in a very familiar and polite voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28430">Sonia rushed to the door in a fright.  </span><span id="en28432">The flaxen head of Mr.  </span><span id="en28434">Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door. </span></p>

<p><span id="en28438">Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28441">"I've come to you, Sofya Semyonovna," he began. " </span><span id="en28443">Excuse me...  </span><span id="en28445">I thought I should find you," he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, "that is, I didn't mean anything...  </span><span id="en28447">of that sort...  </span><span id="en28449">But I just thought...  </span><span id="en28451">Katerina Ivanovna has gone out of her mind," he blurted out suddenly, turning from Raskolnikov to Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28454">Sonia screamed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28457">"At least it seems so.  </span><span id="en28459">But...  </span><span id="en28461">we don't know what to do, you see!  </span><span id="en28463">She came back—she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps beaten....  </span><span id="en28465">So it seems at least,...  </span><span id="en28467">She had run to your father's former chief, she didn't find him at home: he was dining at some other general's....  </span><span id="en28469">Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general's, and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems.  </span><span id="en28471">You can imagine what happened.  </span><span id="en28473">She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own story, she abused him and threw something at him.  </span><span id="en28475">One may well believe it....  </span><span id="en28477">How it is she wasn't taken up, I can't understand!  </span><span id="en28479">Now she is telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it's difficult to understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about....  </span><span id="en28481">Oh yes, she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every day under the general's window...  </span><span id="en28483">'to let everyone see well-born children, whose father was an official, begging in the street. </span><span id="en28485">' She keeps beating the children and they are all crying.  </span><span id="en28487">She is teaching Lida to sing 'My Village,' the boy to dance, Polenka the same.  </span><span id="en28489">She is tearing up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music....  </span><span id="en28491">She won't listen to anything....  </span><span id="en28493">Imagine the state of things!  </span><span id="en28495">It's beyond anything!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28498">Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room, putting on her things as she went.  </span><span id="en28500">Raskolnikov followed her and Lebeziatnikov came after him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28503">"She has certainly gone mad!"  </span><span id="en28505">he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out into the street. " </span><span id="en28507">I didn't want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said 'it seemed like it,' but there isn't a doubt of it.  </span><span id="en28509">They say that in consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it's a pity I know nothing of medicine.  </span><span id="en28511">I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn't listen." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28514">"Did you talk to her about the tubercles?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28517">"Not precisely of the tubercles.  </span><span id="en28519">Besides, she wouldn't have understood!  </span><span id="en28521">But what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he has nothing to cry about, he'll stop crying.  </span><span id="en28523">That's clear.  </span><span id="en28525">Is it your conviction that he won't?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28528">"Life would be too easy if it were so," answered Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28531">"Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the insane, simply by logical argument?  </span><span id="en28533">One professor there, a scientific man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such treatment.  </span><span id="en28535">His idea was that there's nothing really wrong with the physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things.  </span><span id="en28537">He gradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they say he was successful?  </span><span id="en28539">But as he made use of douches too, how far success was due to that treatment remains uncertain....  </span><span id="en28541">So it seems at least." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28544">Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen.  </span><span id="en28546">Reaching the house where he lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate.  </span><span id="en28548">Lebeziatnikov woke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28551">Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle of it.  </span><span id="en28553">Why had he come back here?  </span><span id="en28555">He looked at the yellow and tattered paper, at the dust, at his sofa....  </span><span id="en28557">From the yard came a loud continuous knocking; someone seemed to be hammering...  </span><span id="en28559">He went to the window, rose on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of absorbed attention.  </span><span id="en28561">But the yard was empty and he could not see who was hammering.  </span><span id="en28563">In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums.  </span><span id="en28565">Linen was hung out of the windows...  </span><span id="en28567">He knew it all by heart.  </span><span id="en28569">He turned away and sat down on the sofa. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28572">Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone! </span></p>
<p><span id="en28575">Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now that he had made her more miserable. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28578">"Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears?  </span><span id="en28580">What need had he to poison her life?  </span><span id="en28582">Oh, the meanness of it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28585">"I will remain alone," he said resolutely, "and she shall not come to the prison!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28588">Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile.  </span><span id="en28590">That was a strange thought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28593">"Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia," he thought suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28596">He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging through his mind.  </span><span id="en28598">All at once the door opened and Dounia came in.  </span><span id="en28600">At first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place as yesterday, on the chair facing him.  </span><span id="en28602">He looked silently and almost vacantly at her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28605">"Don't be angry, brother; I've only come for one minute," said Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28608">Her face looked thoughtful but not stern.  </span><span id="en28610">Her eyes were bright and soft.  </span><span id="en28612">He saw that she too had come to him with love. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28614">"Brother, now I know all,  </span><i><span id="en28615">all </span></i><span id="en28617">. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and told me everything.  </span><span id="en28619">They are worrying and persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspicion....  </span><span id="en28621">Dmitri Prokofitch told me that there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror.  </span><span id="en28623">I don't think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you.  </span><span id="en28625">That's what I am afraid of.  </span><span id="en28627">As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don't judge you, I don't venture to judge you, and forgive me for having blamed you for it.  </span><span id="en28629">I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble, should keep away from everyone.  </span><span id="en28630">I shall tell mother nothing  </span><i><span id="en28631">of this </span></i><span id="en28633">, but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that you will come very soon.  </span><span id="en28634">Don't worry about her;  </span><i><span id="en28635">I </span></i><span id="en28636">  </span><span id="en28637">will set her mind at rest; but don't you try her too much—come once at least; remember that she is your mother.  </span><span id="en28639">And now I have come simply to say" (Dounia began to get up) "that if you should need me or should need...  </span><span id="en28641">all my life or anything...  </span><span id="en28643">call me, and I'll come.  </span><span id="en28645">Good-bye!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28651">She turned abruptly and went towards the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28654">"Dounia!"  </span><span id="en28656">Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. " </span><span id="en28658">That Razumihin, Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28661">Dounia flushed slightly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28664">"Well?"  </span><span id="en28666">she asked, waiting a moment. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28669">"He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....  </span><span id="en28671">Good-bye, Dounia." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28674">Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28677">"But what does it mean, brother?  </span><span id="en28679">Are we really parting for ever that you...  </span><span id="en28681">give me such a parting message?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28684">"Never mind....  </span><span id="en28686">Good-bye." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28689">He turned away, and walked to the window.  </span><span id="en28691">She stood a moment, looked at him uneasily, and went out troubled. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28694">No, he was not cold to her.  </span><span id="en28695">There was an instant (the very last one) when he had longed to take her in his arms and  </span><i><span id="en28696">say good-bye </span></i><span id="en28697"> to her, and even  </span><i><span id="en28698">to tell </span></i><span id="en28699">  </span><span id="en28700">her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28705">"Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and will feel that I stole her kiss." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28707">"And would  </span><i><span id="en28708">she </span></i><span id="en28709">  </span><span id="en28710">stand that test?"  </span><span id="en28712">he went on a few minutes later to himself. " </span><span id="en28714">No, she wouldn't; girls like that can't stand things!  </span><span id="en28716">They never do." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28720">And he thought of Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28723">There was a breath of fresh air from the window.  </span><span id="en28725">The daylight was fading.  </span><span id="en28727">He took up his cap and went out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28730">He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was.  </span><span id="en28732">But all this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him.  </span><span id="en28734">And if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his faculties.  </span><span id="en28736">But this artificial excitement could not last long. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28739">He wandered aimlessly.  </span><span id="en28741">The sun was setting.  </span><span id="en28743">A special form of misery had begun to oppress him of late.  </span><span id="en28745">There was nothing poignant, nothing acute about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it; it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a foretaste of an eternity "on a square yard of space."  </span><span id="en28747">Towards evening this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28750">"With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or something, one can't help doing something stupid!  </span><span id="en28752">You'll go to Dounia, as well as to Sonia," he muttered bitterly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28755">He heard his name called.  </span><span id="en28757">He looked round.  </span><span id="en28759">Lebeziatnikov rushed up to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28762">"Only fancy, I've been to your room looking for you.  </span><span id="en28764">Only fancy, she's carried out her plan, and taken away the children.  </span><span id="en28766">Sofya Semyonovna and I have had a job to find them.  </span><span id="en28768">She is rapping on a frying-pan and making the children dance.  </span><span id="en28770">The children are crying.  </span><span id="en28772">They keep stopping at the cross-roads and in front of shops; there's a crowd of fools running after them.  </span><span id="en28774">Come along!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28777">"And Sonia?"  </span><span id="en28779">Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28782">"Simply frantic.  </span><span id="en28784">That is, it's not Sofya Semyonovna's frantic, but Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova's frantic too.  </span><span id="en28786">But Katerina Ivanovna is absolutely frantic.  </span><span id="en28788">I tell you she is quite mad.  </span><span id="en28790">They'll be taken to the police.  </span><span id="en28792">You can fancy what an effect that will have....  </span><span id="en28794">They are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya Semyonovna's, quite close." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28797">On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally of gutter children.  </span><span id="en28799">The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to attract a street crowd.  </span><span id="en28801">Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way on one side, was really frantic.  </span><span id="en28803">She was exhausted and breathless.  </span><span id="en28805">Her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.  </span><span id="en28807">But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew more intense.  </span><span id="en28809">She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by their not understanding, beat them....  </span><span id="en28811">Then she would make a rush at the crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she immediately appealed to him to see what these children "from a genteel, one may say aristocratic, house" had been brought to.  </span><span id="en28813">If she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling with them.  </span><span id="en28815">Some people laughed, others shook their heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the frightened children.  </span><span id="en28817">The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it.  </span><span id="en28819">But instead of rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands, when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing.  </span><span id="en28821">She too joined in the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough, which made her curse in despair and even shed tears.  </span><span id="en28823">What made her most furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida.  </span><span id="en28825">Some effort had been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed.  </span><span id="en28827">The boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.  </span><span id="en28829">There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap, or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina Ivanovna's grandmother's and had been preserved as a family possession.  </span><span id="en28831">Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears.  </span><span id="en28833">She dimly realised her mother's condition, and looked uneasily about her.  </span><span id="en28835">She was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd.  </span><span id="en28837">Sonia followed Katerina Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina Ivanovna was not to be persuaded. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28840">"Leave off, Sonia, leave off," she shouted, speaking fast, panting and coughing. " </span><span id="en28842">You don't know what you ask; you are like a child!  </span><span id="en28844">I've told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German.  </span><span id="en28846">Let everyone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets, though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service."  </span><span id="en28848">(Katerina Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly believed it. </span><span id="en28850">) "Let that wretch of a general see it!  </span><span id="en28852">And you are silly, Sonia: what have we to eat?  </span><span id="en28854">Tell me that.  </span><span id="en28856">We have worried you enough, I won't go on so!  </span><span id="en28858">Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?"  </span><span id="en28860">she cried, seeing Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. " </span><span id="en28862">Explain to this silly girl, please, that nothing better could be done!  </span><span id="en28864">Even organ-grinders earn their living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary.  </span><span id="en28866">And that general will lose his post, you'll see!  </span><span id="en28868">We shall perform under his windows every day, and if the Tsar drives by, I'll fall on my knees, put the children before me, show them to him, and say 'Defend us father. </span><span id="en28870">' He is the father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he'll protect us, you'll see, and that wretch of a general....  </span><span id="en28871">Lida,  </span><i><span id="en28872">tenez vous droite </span></i><span id="en28874">! Kolya, you'll dance again.  </span><span id="en28876">Why are you whimpering?  </span><span id="en28878">Whimpering again!  </span><span id="en28880">What are you afraid of, stupid?  </span><span id="en28882">Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion Romanovitch?  </span><span id="en28884">If you only knew how stupid they are!  </span><span id="en28886">What's one to do with such children?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en28890">And she, almost crying herself—which did not stop her uninterrupted, rapid flow of talk—pointed to the crying children.  </span><span id="en28892">Raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity, that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a boarding-school. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28895">"A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha!  </span><span id="en28897">A castle in the air," cried Katerina Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. " </span><span id="en28899">No, Rodion Romanovitch, that dream is over!  </span><span id="en28901">All have forsaken us!...  </span><span id="en28903">And that general....  </span><span id="en28905">You know, Rodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him—it happened to be standing in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name.  </span><span id="en28907">I wrote my name, threw it at him and ran away.  </span><span id="en28909">Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!  </span><span id="en28911">But enough of them, now I'll provide for the children myself, I won't bow down to anybody!  </span><span id="en28913">She has had to bear enough for us!"  </span><span id="en28915">she pointed to Sonia. " </span><span id="en28917">Polenka, how much have you got?  </span><span id="en28919">Show me!  </span><span id="en28921">What, only two farthings!  </span><span id="en28923">Oh, the mean wretches!  </span><span id="en28925">They give us nothing, only run after us, putting their tongues out.  </span><span id="en28927">There, what is that blockhead laughing at?"  </span><span id="en28929">(She pointed to a man in the crowd. </span><span id="en28931">) "It's all because Kolya here is so stupid; I have such a bother with him.  </span><span id="en28933">What do you want, Polenka?  </span><span id="en28934">Tell me in French,  </span><i><span id="en28935">parlez-moi français </span></i><span id="en28937">. Why, I've taught you, you know some phrases.  </span><span id="en28939">Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders?  </span><span id="en28941">We aren't going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel song....  </span><span id="en28943">Ah, yes,...  </span><span id="en28945">What are we to sing?  </span><span id="en28947">You keep putting me out, but we...  </span><span id="en28949">you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find something to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to....  </span><span id="en28951">For, as you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu....  </span><span id="en28953">We must talk it over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky, where there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed at once.  </span><span id="en28955">Lida knows 'My Village' only, nothing but 'My Village,' and everyone sings that.  </span><span id="en28957">We must sing something far more genteel....  </span><span id="en28959">Well, have you thought of anything, Polenka?  </span><span id="en28961">If only you'd help your mother!  </span><span id="en28963">My memory's quite gone, or I should have thought of something.  </span><span id="en28965">We really can't sing 'An Hussar. </span><span id="en28967">' Ah, let us sing in French, 'Cinq sous,' I have taught it you, I have taught it you.  </span><span id="en28969">And as it is in French, people will see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much more touching....  </span><span id="en28971">You might sing 'Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre,' for that's quite a child's song and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses. </span></p>
<p><span id="en28974">" </span><i><span id="en28975">Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra </span></i><span id="en28977">..."  </span><span id="en28979">she began singing. " </span><span id="en28981">But no, better sing 'Cinq sous. </span><span id="en28983">' Now, Kolya, your hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands! </span></p>
<p><span id="en28986">" </span><i><span id="en28987">Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage </span></i><span id="en28988">." </span></p>
<p><span id="en28991">(Cough-cough-cough! </span><span id="en28993">) "Set your dress straight, Polenka, it's slipped down on your shoulders," she observed, panting from coughing. " </span><span id="en28995">Now it's particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may see that you are well-born children.  </span><span id="en28997">I said at the time that the bodice should be cut longer, and made of two widths.  </span><span id="en28999">It was your fault, Sonia, with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite deformed by it....  </span><span id="en29001">Why, you're all crying again!  </span><span id="en29003">What's the matter, stupids?  </span><span id="en29005">Come, Kolya, begin.  </span><span id="en29007">Make haste, make haste!  </span><span id="en29009">Oh, what an unbearable child! </span></p>
<p><span id="en29012">"Cinq sous, cinq sous. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29015">"A policeman again!  </span><span id="en29017">What do you want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29020">A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd.  </span><span id="en29022">But at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat—a solid-looking official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)—approached and without a word handed her a green three-rouble note.  </span><span id="en29024">His face wore a look of genuine sympathy.  </span><span id="en29026">Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a polite, even ceremonious, bow. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29029">"I thank you, honoured sir," she began loftily. " </span><span id="en29031">The causes that have induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).  </span><span id="en29033">You see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family—I might even say of aristocratic connections—and that wretch of a general sat eating grouse...  </span><span id="en29035">and stamped at my disturbing him.  </span><span id="en29037">'Your excellency,' I said, 'protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch, and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his only daughter. </span><span id="en29039">'...  </span><span id="en29041">That policeman again!  </span><span id="en29043">Protect me," she cried to the official. " </span><span id="en29045">Why is that policeman edging up to me?  </span><span id="en29047">We have only just run away from one of them.  </span><span id="en29049">What do you want, fool?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29052">"It's forbidden in the streets.  </span><span id="en29054">You mustn't make a disturbance." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29057">"It's you're making a disturbance.  </span><span id="en29059">It's just the same as if I were grinding an organ.  </span><span id="en29061">What business is it of yours?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29064">"You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven't got one, and in that way you collect a crowd.  </span><span id="en29066">Where do you lodge?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29069">"What, a license?"  </span><span id="en29071">wailed Katerina Ivanovna. " </span><span id="en29073">I buried my husband to-day.  </span><span id="en29075">What need of a license?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29078">"Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself," began the official. " </span><span id="en29080">Come along; I will escort you....  </span><span id="en29082">This is no place for you in the crowd.  </span><span id="en29084">You are ill." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29087">"Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don't know," screamed Katerina Ivanovna. " </span><span id="en29089">We are going to the Nevsky....  </span><span id="en29091">Sonia, Sonia!  </span><span id="en29093">Where is she?  </span><span id="en29095">She is crying too!  </span><span id="en29097">What's the matter with you all?  </span><span id="en29099">Kolya, Lida, where are you going?"  </span><span id="en29101">she cried suddenly in alarm. " </span><span id="en29103">Oh, silly children!  </span><span id="en29105">Kolya, Lida, where are they off to?..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29108">Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their mother's mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.  </span><span id="en29110">Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them.  </span><span id="en29112">She was a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for breath.  </span><span id="en29114">Sonia and Polenka rushed after them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29117">"Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia!  </span><span id="en29119">Oh stupid, ungrateful children!...  </span><span id="en29121">Polenka!  </span><span id="en29123">catch them....  </span><span id="en29125">It's for your sakes I..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29128">She stumbled as she ran and fell down. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29131">"She's cut herself, she's bleeding!  </span><span id="en29133">Oh, dear!"  </span><span id="en29135">cried Sonia, bending over her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29138">All ran up and crowded around.  </span><span id="en29140">Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the first at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the policeman who muttered, "Bother!"  </span><span id="en29142">with a gesture of impatience, feeling that the job was going to be a troublesome one. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29145">"Pass on!  </span><span id="en29147">Pass on!"  </span><span id="en29149">he said to the crowd that pressed forward. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29152">"She's dying," someone shouted. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29155">"She's gone out of her mind," said another. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29158">"Lord have mercy upon us," said a woman, crossing herself. " </span><span id="en29160">Have they caught the little girl and the boy?  </span><span id="en29162">They're being brought back, the elder one's got them....  </span><span id="en29164">Ah, the naughty imps!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29167">When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood that stained the pavement red was from her chest. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29170">"I've seen that before," muttered the official to Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov; "that's consumption; the blood flows and chokes the patient.  </span><span id="en29172">I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...  </span><span id="en29174">nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute....  </span><span id="en29176">What's to be done though?  </span><span id="en29178">She is dying." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29181">"This way, this way, to my room!"  </span><span id="en29183">Sonia implored. " </span><span id="en29185">I live here!...  </span><span id="en29187">See, that house, the second from here....  </span><span id="en29189">Come to me, make haste," she turned from one to the other. " </span><span id="en29191">Send for the doctor!  </span><span id="en29193">Oh, dear!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29196">Thanks to the official's efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna.  </span><span id="en29198">She was carried to Sonia's room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed.  </span><span id="en29200">The blood was still flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself.  </span><span id="en29202">Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door.  </span><span id="en29204">Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who were trembling and weeping.  </span><span id="en29206">Several persons came in too from the Kapernaumovs' room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces.  </span><span id="en29208">Among these, Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance.  </span><span id="en29210">Raskolnikov looked at him with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd.  </span><span id="en29212">A doctor and priest wore spoken of.  </span><span id="en29214">The official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for.  </span><span id="en29216">Kapernaumov ran himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29219">Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath.  </span><span id="en29221">The bleeding ceased for a time.  </span><span id="en29223">She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with a handkerchief.  </span><span id="en29225">At last she asked to be raised.  </span><span id="en29227">They sat her up on the bed, supporting her on both sides. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29230">"Where are the children?"  </span><span id="en29232">she said in a faint voice. " </span><span id="en29234">You've brought them, Polenka?  </span><span id="en29236">Oh the sillies!  </span><span id="en29238">Why did you run away....  </span><span id="en29240">Och!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29243">Once more her parched lips were covered with blood.  </span><span id="en29245">She moved her eyes, looking about her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29248">"So that's how you live, Sonia!  </span><span id="en29250">Never once have I been in your room." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29253">She looked at her with a face of suffering. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29256">"We have been your ruin, Sonia.  </span><span id="en29258">Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here!  </span><span id="en29260">Well, here they are, Sonia, take them all!  </span><span id="en29262">I hand them over to you, I've had enough!  </span><span id="en29264">The ball is over."  </span><span id="en29266">(Cough! </span><span id="en29268">) "Lay me down, let me die in peace." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29271">They laid her back on the pillow. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29274">"What, the priest?  </span><span id="en29276">I don't want him.  </span><span id="en29278">You haven't got a rouble to spare.  </span><span id="en29280">I have no sins.  </span><span id="en29282">God must forgive me without that.  </span><span id="en29284">He knows how I have suffered....  </span><span id="en29286">And if He won't forgive me, I don't care!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29289">She sank more and more into uneasy delirium.  </span><span id="en29291">At times she shuddered, turned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute, but at once sank into delirium again.  </span><span id="en29293">Her breathing was hoarse and difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29296">"I said to him, your excellency," she ejaculated, gasping after each word. " </span><span id="en29298">That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah!  </span><span id="en29300">Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips, make haste!  </span><i><span id="en29303">Glissez, glissez!  </span><span id="en29305">pas de basque! </span></i><span id="en29307">  </span><span id="en29308">Tap with your heels, be a graceful child! </span></p>

<p><span id="en29324">" </span><i><span id="en29326">Du hast die schonsten Augen Madchen, was willst du mehr? </span></i></p>
<p><span id="en29333">"What an idea!  </span><i><span id="en29336">Was willst du mehr? </span></i><span id="en29338">  </span><span id="en29339">What things the fool invents!  </span><span id="en29341">Ah, yes! </span></p>
<p><span id="en29347">"In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29350">"Ah, how I loved it!  </span><span id="en29352">I loved that song to distraction, Polenka!  </span><span id="en29354">Your father, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged....  </span><span id="en29356">Oh those days!  </span><span id="en29358">Oh that's the thing for us to sing!  </span><span id="en29360">How does it go?  </span><span id="en29362">I've forgotten.  </span><span id="en29364">Remind me!  </span><span id="en29366">How was it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29369">She was violently excited and tried to sit up.  </span><span id="en29371">At last, in a horribly hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word, with a look of growing terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29374">"In the heat of midday!...  </span><span id="en29376">in the vale!...  </span><span id="en29378">of Dagestan!...  </span><span id="en29380">With lead in my breast!..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29383">"Your excellency!"  </span><span id="en29385">she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and a flood of tears, "protect the orphans!  </span><span id="en29387">You have been their father's guest...  </span><span id="en29389">one may say aristocratic...."  </span><span id="en29391">She started, regaining consciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once recognised Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29394">"Sonia, Sonia!"  </span><span id="en29396">she articulated softly and caressingly, as though surprised to find her there. " </span><span id="en29398">Sonia darling, are you here, too?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29401">They lifted her up again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29404">"Enough!  </span><span id="en29406">It's over!  </span><span id="en29408">Farewell, poor thing!  </span><span id="en29410">I am done for!  </span><span id="en29412">I am broken!"  </span><span id="en29414">she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the pillow. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29417">She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.  </span><span id="en29419">Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29422">Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless with her head pressed to the dead woman's wasted bosom.  </span><span id="en29424">Polenka threw herself at her mother's feet, kissing them and weeping violently.  </span><span id="en29426">Though Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other's little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened their mouths and began screaming.  </span><span id="en29428">They were both still in their fancy dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29431">And how did "the certificate of merit" come to be on the bed beside Katerina Ivanovna?  </span><span id="en29433">It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29436">He walked away to the window.  </span><span id="en29438">Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29441">"She is dead," he said. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29444">"Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you," said Svidrigaïlov, coming up to them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29447">Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.  </span><span id="en29449">Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29452">"I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that.  </span><span id="en29454">You know it's a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare.  </span><span id="en29456">I will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum, and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them.  </span><span id="en29458">And I will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn't she?  </span><span id="en29460">So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29463">"What is your motive for such benevolence?"  </span><span id="en29465">asked Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29468">"Ah!  </span><span id="en29470">you sceptical person!"  </span><span id="en29472">laughed Svidrigaïlov. " </span><span id="en29474">I told you I had no need of that money.  </span><span id="en29476">Won't you admit that it's simply done from humanity?  </span><span id="en29478">She wasn't 'a louse,' you know" (he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay), "was she, like some old pawnbroker woman?  </span><span id="en29480">Come, you'll agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to die?  </span><span id="en29482">And if I didn't help them, Polenka would go the same way." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29485">He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own phrases, spoken to Sonia.  </span><span id="en29487">He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29490">"How do you know?"  </span><span id="en29492">he whispered, hardly able to breathe. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29495">"Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich's, the other side of the wall.  </span><span id="en29497">Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted friend of mine.  </span><span id="en29499">I am a neighbour." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29502">"You?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29505">"Yes," continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. " </span><span id="en29507">I assure you on my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me enormously.  </span><span id="en29509">I told you we should become friends, I foretold it.  </span><span id="en29511">Well, here we have.  </span><span id="en29513">And you will see what an accommodating person I am.  </span><span id="en29515">You'll see that you can get on with me!" </span></p>

<p><span id="en29520">A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape.  </span><span id="en29522">Recalling that period long after, he believed that his mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with intervals, till the final catastrophe.  </span><span id="en29524">He was convinced that he had been mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date of certain events.  </span><span id="en29526">Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him.  </span><span id="en29528">He had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination.  </span><span id="en29530">At times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes to panic.  </span><span id="en29532">But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days, of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes seen in the dying.  </span><span id="en29534">He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape from a full and clear understanding of his position.  </span><span id="en29536">Certain essential facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome to him.  </span><span id="en29538">How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable ruin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29541">He was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en29543">From the time of Svidrigaïlov's too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia's room at the moment of Katerina Ivanovna's death, the normal working of his mind seemed to break down.  </span><span id="en29545">But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness, Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it.  </span><span id="en29547">At times, finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had come there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en29549">He recognised suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding with that man and to make what terms he could.  </span><span id="en29551">Walking outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en29553">Another time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could not at first understand how he had come there. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29556">But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna's death, he had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia's lodging, where he had gone aimlessly for a moment.  </span><span id="en29558">They exchanged a few words and made no reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a time. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29561">Katerina Ivanovna's body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was busy making arrangements for the funeral.  </span><span id="en29563">Sonia too was very busy.  </span><span id="en29565">At their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna's children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place orphans with some property than destitute ones.  </span><span id="en29567">He said something too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see Raskolnikov, mentioning that "he would like to consult with him, that there were things they must talk over...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29570">This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs.  </span><span id="en29572">Svidrigaïlov looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause, dropping his voice, asked: "But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you don't seem yourself?  </span><span id="en29574">You look and you listen, but you don't seem to understand.  </span><span id="en29576">Cheer up!  </span><span id="en29578">We'll talk things over; I am only sorry, I've so much to do of my own business and other people's.  </span><span id="en29580">Ah, Rodion Romanovitch," he added suddenly, "what all men need is fresh air, fresh air...  </span><span id="en29582">more than anything!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29585">He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who were coming up the stairs.  </span><span id="en29587">They had come for the requiem service.  </span><span id="en29589">By Svidrigaïlov's orders it was sung twice a day punctually.  </span><span id="en29591">Svidrigaïlov went his way.  </span><span id="en29593">Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed the priest into Sonia's room.  </span><span id="en29595">He stood at the door.  </span><span id="en29597">They began quietly, slowly and mournfully singing the service.  </span><span id="en29599">From his childhood the thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem service.  </span><span id="en29601">And there was something else here as well, too awful and disturbing.  </span><span id="en29603">He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the coffin; Polenka was weeping.  </span><span id="en29605">Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it were, timidly weeping. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29608">"These last two days she hasn't said a word to me, she hasn't glanced at me," Raskolnikov thought suddenly.  </span><span id="en29610">The sunlight was bright in the room; the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, "Give rest, oh Lord...."  </span><span id="en29612">Raskolnikov stayed all through the service.  </span><span id="en29614">As he blessed them and took his leave, the priest looked round strangely.  </span><span id="en29616">After the service, Raskolnikov went up to Sonia.  </span><span id="en29618">She took both his hands and let her head sink on his shoulder.  </span><span id="en29620">This slight friendly gesture bewildered Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en29622">It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand.  </span><span id="en29624">It was the furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29627">Sonia said nothing.  </span><span id="en29629">Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out.  </span><span id="en29631">He felt very miserable.  </span><span id="en29633">If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life there.  </span><span id="en29635">But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had never been able to feel alone.  </span><span id="en29637">Sometimes he walked out of the town on to the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him.  </span><span id="en29639">It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares.  </span><span id="en29641">There he felt easier and even more solitary.  </span><span id="en29643">One day at dusk he sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively enjoyed it.  </span><span id="en29645">But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again, as though his conscience smote him. " </span><span id="en29647">Here I sit listening to singing, is that what I ought to be doing?"  </span><span id="en29649">he thought.  </span><span id="en29651">Yet he felt at once that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly understand or put into words.  </span><span id="en29653">It was a hopeless tangle. " </span><span id="en29655">No, better the struggle again!  </span><span id="en29657">Better Porfiry again...  </span><span id="en29659">or Svidrigaïlov....  </span><span id="en29661">Better some challenge again...  </span><span id="en29663">some attack.  </span><span id="en29665">Yes, yes!"  </span><span id="en29667">he thought.  </span><span id="en29669">He went out of the tavern and rushed away almost at a run.  </span><span id="en29671">The thought of Dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic.  </span><span id="en29673">That night he woke up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he arrived.  </span><span id="en29675">After some hours' sleep the fever left him, but he woke up late, two o'clock in the afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29678">He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna's funeral had been fixed for that day, and was glad that he was not present at it.  </span><span id="en29680">Nastasya brought him some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness.  </span><span id="en29682">His head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three days.  </span><span id="en29684">He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29687">The door opened and Razumihin came in. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29690">"Ah, he's eating, then he's not ill," said Razumihin.  </span><span id="en29692">He took a chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29695">He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it.  </span><span id="en29697">He spoke with evident annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice.  </span><span id="en29699">He looked as though he had some special fixed determination. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29702">"Listen," he began resolutely. " </span><span id="en29704">As far as I am concerned, you may all go to hell, but from what I see, it's clear to me that I can't make head or tail of it; please don't think I've come to ask you questions.  </span><span id="en29706">I don't want to know, hang it!  </span><span id="en29708">If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say I shouldn't stay to listen, I should go away cursing.  </span><span id="en29710">I have only come to find out once for all whether it's a fact that you are mad?  </span><span id="en29712">There is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so.  </span><span id="en29714">I admit I've been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister.  </span><span id="en29716">Only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have; so you must be mad." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29719">"When did you see them last?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29722">"Just now.  </span><span id="en29724">Haven't you seen them since then?  </span><span id="en29726">What have you been doing with yourself?  </span><span id="en29728">Tell me, please.  </span><span id="en29730">I've been to you three times already.  </span><span id="en29732">Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday.  </span><span id="en29734">She had made up her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she wouldn't hear a word.  </span><span id="en29736">'If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can look after him like his mother? </span><span id="en29738">' she said.  </span><span id="en29740">We all came here together, we couldn't let her come alone all the way.  </span><span id="en29742">We kept begging her to be calm.  </span><span id="en29744">We came in, you weren't here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes, while we stood waiting in silence.  </span><span id="en29746">She got up and said: 'If he's gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it's humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness. </span><span id="en29748">' She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.  </span><span id="en29749">'I see,' she said, 'that he has time for  </span><i><span id="en29750">his girl </span></i><span id="en29751">.' She means by  </span><i><span id="en29752">your girl </span></i><span id="en29753">  </span><span id="en29754">Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don't know.  </span><span id="en29756">I went at once to Sofya Semyonovna's, for I wanted to know what was going on.  </span><span id="en29758">I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses.  </span><span id="en29760">No sign of you.  </span><span id="en29762">I apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en29764">So that's all nonsense and you haven't got a girl; the most likely thing is that you are mad.  </span><span id="en29766">But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you'd not had a bite for three days.  </span><span id="en29768">Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but though you have not said a word to me yet...  </span><span id="en29770">you are not mad!  </span><span id="en29772">That I'd swear!  </span><span id="en29774">Above all, you are not mad!  </span><span id="en29776">So you may go to hell, all of you, for there's some mystery, some secret about it, and I don't intend to worry my brains over your secrets.  </span><span id="en29778">So I've simply come to swear at you," he finished, getting up, "to relieve my mind.  </span><span id="en29780">And I know what to do now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29785">"What do you mean to do now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29788">"What business is it of yours what I mean to do?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29791">"You are going in for a drinking bout." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29794">"How...  </span><span id="en29796">how did you know?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29799">"Why, it's pretty plain." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29802">Razumihin paused for a minute. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29805">"You always have been a very rational person and you've never been mad, never," he observed suddenly with warmth. " </span><span id="en29807">You're right: I shall drink.  </span><span id="en29809">Good-bye!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29812">And he moved to go out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29815">"I was talking with my sister—the day before yesterday, I think it was—about you, Razumihin." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29818">"About me!  </span><span id="en29820">But...  </span><span id="en29822">where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?"  </span><span id="en29824">Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29827">One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29830">"She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29833">"She did!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29836">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29839">"What did you say to her...  </span><span id="en29841">I mean, about me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29844">"I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man.  </span><span id="en29846">I didn't tell her you love her, because she knows that herself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29849">"She knows that herself?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29852">"Well, it's pretty plain.  </span><span id="en29854">Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me, you would remain to look after them.  </span><span id="en29856">I, so to speak, give them into your keeping, Razumihin.  </span><span id="en29858">I say this because I know quite well how you love her, and am convinced of the purity of your heart.  </span><span id="en29860">I know that she too may love you and perhaps does love you already.  </span><span id="en29862">Now decide for yourself, as you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29865">"Rodya!  </span><span id="en29867">You see...  </span><span id="en29869">well....  </span><span id="en29871">Ach, damn it!  </span><span id="en29873">But where do you mean to go?  </span><span id="en29875">Of course, if it's all a secret, never mind....  </span><span id="en29877">But I...  </span><span id="en29879">I shall find out the secret...  </span><span id="en29881">and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you've made it all up.  </span><span id="en29883">Anyway you are a capital fellow, a capital fellow!..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29886">"That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets.  </span><span id="en29888">Leave it to time, don't worry about it.  </span><span id="en29890">You'll know it all in time when it must be.  </span><span id="en29892">Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air.  </span><span id="en29894">I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29897">Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent conclusion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29900">"He's a political conspirator!  </span><span id="en29902">He must be.  </span><span id="en29904">And he's on the eve of some desperate step, that's certain.  </span><span id="en29906">It can only be that!  </span><span id="en29908">And...  </span><span id="en29910">and Dounia knows," he thought suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29913">"So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you," he said, weighing each syllable, "and you're going to see a man who says we need more air, and so of course that letter...  </span><span id="en29915">that too must have something to do with it," he concluded to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29918">"What letter?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29921">"She got a letter to-day.  </span><span id="en29923">It upset her very much—very much indeed.  </span><span id="en29925">Too much so.  </span><span id="en29927">I began speaking of you, she begged me not to.  </span><span id="en29929">Then...  </span><span id="en29931">then she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part...  </span><span id="en29933">then she began warmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked herself in." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29936">"She got a letter?"  </span><span id="en29938">Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29941">"Yes, and you didn't know?  </span><span id="en29943">hm..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en29946">They were both silent. </span></p>
<p><span id="en29949">"Good-bye, Rodion.  </span><span id="en29951">There was a time, brother, when I....  </span><span id="en29953">Never mind, good-bye.  </span><span id="en29955">You see, there was a time....  </span><span id="en29957">Well, good-bye!  </span><span id="en29959">I must be off too.  </span><span id="en29961">I am not going to drink.  </span><span id="en29963">There's no need now....  </span><span id="en29965">That's all stuff!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29967">He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he suddenly opened it again, and said, looking away: </span></p>
<p><span id="en29969">"Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry's, that old woman?  </span><span id="en29971">Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed and given the proofs.  </span><span id="en29973">It's one of those very workmen, the painter, only fancy!  </span><span id="en29975">Do you remember I defended them here?  </span><span id="en29977">Would you believe it, all that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion.  </span><span id="en29979">The cunning, the presence of mind of the young dog!  </span><span id="en29981">One can hardly credit it; but it's his own explanation, he has confessed it all.  </span><span id="en29983">And what a fool I was about it!  </span><span id="en29985">Well, he's simply a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of the lawyers—so there's nothing much to wonder at, I suppose!  </span><span id="en29987">Of course people like that are always possible.  </span><span id="en29989">And the fact that he couldn't keep up the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in.  </span><span id="en29991">But what a fool I was!  </span><span id="en29993">I was frantic on their side!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en29996">"Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest you so?"  </span><span id="en29998">Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30001">"What next?  </span><span id="en30003">You ask me why it interests me!...  </span><span id="en30005">Well, I heard it from Porfiry, among others...  </span><span id="en30007">It was from him I heard almost all about it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30010">"From Porfiry?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30013">"From Porfiry." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30016">"What...  </span><span id="en30018">what did he say?"  </span><span id="en30020">Raskolnikov asked in dismay. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30023">"He gave me a capital explanation of it.  </span><span id="en30025">Psychologically, after his fashion." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30028">"He explained it?  </span><span id="en30030">Explained it himself?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30033">"Yes, yes; good-bye.  </span><span id="en30035">I'll tell you all about it another time, but now I'm busy.  </span><span id="en30037">There was a time when I fancied...  </span><span id="en30039">But no matter, another time!...  </span><span id="en30041">What need is there for me to drink now?  </span><span id="en30043">You have made me drunk without wine.  </span><span id="en30045">I am drunk, Rodya!  </span><span id="en30047">Good-bye, I'm going.  </span><span id="en30049">I'll come again very soon." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30052">He went out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30055">"He's a political conspirator, there's not a doubt about it," Razumihin decided, as he slowly descended the stairs. " </span><span id="en30057">And he's drawn his sister in; that's quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna's character.  </span><span id="en30059">There are interviews between them!...  </span><span id="en30061">She hinted at it too...  </span><span id="en30063">So many of her words....  </span><span id="en30065">and hints...  </span><span id="en30067">bear that meaning!  </span><span id="en30069">And how else can all this tangle be explained?  </span><span id="en30071">Hm!  </span><span id="en30073">And I was almost thinking...  </span><span id="en30075">Good heavens, what I thought!  </span><span id="en30077">Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him!  </span><span id="en30079">It was his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day.  </span><span id="en30081">Pfoo!  </span><span id="en30083">What a crude, nasty, vile idea on my part!  </span><span id="en30085">Nikolay is a brick, for confessing....  </span><span id="en30087">And how clear it all is now!  </span><span id="en30089">His illness then, all his strange actions...  </span><span id="en30091">before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....  </span><span id="en30093">But what's the meaning now of that letter?  </span><span id="en30095">There's something in that, too, perhaps.  </span><span id="en30097">Whom was it from?  </span><span id="en30099">I suspect...!  </span><span id="en30101">No, I must find out!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30104">He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed, and he suddenly broke into a run. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30107">As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window, walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the smallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa.  </span><span id="en30109">He felt, so to speak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30112">"Yes, a means of escape had come!  </span><span id="en30114">It had been too stifling, too cramping, the burden had been too agonising.  </span><span id="en30116">A lethargy had come upon him at times.  </span><span id="en30118">From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry's he had been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape.  </span><span id="en30120">After Nikolay's confession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and fundamentally!  </span><span id="en30122">And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his mind! </span></p>
<p><span id="en30125">"And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle...  </span><span id="en30127">He worried him, that was true, but somehow not on the same point.  </span><span id="en30129">He might still have a struggle to come with Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en30131">Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but Porfiry was a different matter. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30133">"And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it  </span><i><span id="en30134">psychologically </span></i><span id="en30136">. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!  </span><span id="en30138">Porfiry?  </span><span id="en30139">But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that Nikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay's appearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only  </span><i><span id="en30140">one </span></i><span id="en30141">  </span><span id="en30142">explanation?  </span><span id="en30144">(During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled passages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind rest on it. </span><span id="en30146">) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30151">"And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect!  </span><span id="en30153">The scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then.  </span><span id="en30155">He had rushed to Porfiry....  </span><span id="en30157">But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?  </span><span id="en30159">What had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay?  </span><span id="en30161">He must have some plan; there was some design, but what was it?  </span><span id="en30163">It was true that a long time had passed since that morning—too long a time—and no sight nor sound of Porfiry.  </span><span id="en30165">Well, that was a bad sign...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30168">Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering.  </span><span id="en30170">It was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind, at least. " </span><span id="en30172">I must settle Svidrigaïlov," he thought, "and as soon as possible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own accord."  </span><span id="en30174">And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart that he might have killed either of those two—Porfiry or Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en30176">At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it later, if not now. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30179">"We shall see, we shall see," he repeated to himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30182">But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry himself in the passage.  </span><span id="en30184">He was coming in to see him.  </span><span id="en30186">Raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute.  </span><span id="en30188">Strange to say, he was not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him.  </span><span id="en30190">He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard. " </span><span id="en30192">Perhaps this will mean the end?  </span><span id="en30194">But how could Porfiry have approached so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing?  </span><span id="en30196">Could he have been listening at the door?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30199">"You didn't expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch," Porfiry explained, laughing. " </span><span id="en30201">I've been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by and thought why not go in for five minutes.  </span><span id="en30203">Are you going out?  </span><span id="en30205">I won't keep you long.  </span><span id="en30207">Just let me have one cigarette." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30210">"Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down."  </span><span id="en30212">Raskolnikov gave his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at himself, if he could have seen it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30215">The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained!  </span><span id="en30217">So a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30220">Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him without flinching.  </span><span id="en30222">Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30225">"Speak, speak," seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov's heart. " </span><span id="en30227">Come, why don't you speak?" </span></p>

<p><span id="en30231">"Ah these cigarettes!"  </span><span id="en30233">Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having lighted one. " </span><span id="en30235">They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I can't give them up!  </span><span id="en30237">I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing.  </span><span id="en30239">You know I am a coward, I went lately to Dr.  </span><span id="en30241">B——n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient.  </span><span id="en30243">He positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: 'Tobacco's bad for you,' he said, 'your lungs are affected. </span><span id="en30245">' But how am I to give it up?  </span><span id="en30247">What is there to take its place?  </span><span id="en30249">I don't drink, that's the mischief, he-he-he, that I don't.  </span><span id="en30251">Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch, everything is relative!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30254">"Why, he's playing his professional tricks again," Raskolnikov thought with disgust.  </span><span id="en30256">All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30259">"I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn't know?"  </span><span id="en30261">Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. " </span><span id="en30263">I came into this very room.  </span><span id="en30265">I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought I'd return your call.  </span><span id="en30267">I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.  </span><span id="en30269">Don't you lock your door?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30272">Raskolnikov's face grew more and more gloomy.  </span><span id="en30274">Porfiry seemed to guess his state of mind. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30277">"I've come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!  </span><span id="en30279">I owe you an explanation and must give it to you," he continued with a slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov's knee. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30282">But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it.  </span><span id="en30284">He had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30287">"A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en30289">Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then...  </span><span id="en30291">and one thing after another!  </span><span id="en30293">This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you; I feel it.  </span><span id="en30295">Do you remember how we parted?  </span><span id="en30297">Your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine.  </span><span id="en30299">And, you know, our behaviour was unseemly, even ungentlemanly.  </span><span id="en30301">And yet we are gentlemen, above all, in any case, gentlemen; that must be understood.  </span><span id="en30303">Do you remember what we came to?...  </span><span id="en30305">and it was quite indecorous." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30308">"What is he up to, what does he take me for?"  </span><span id="en30310">Raskolnikov asked himself in amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30313">"I've decided openness is better between us," Porfiry Petrovitch went on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles. " </span><span id="en30315">Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long.  </span><span id="en30317">Nikolay put a stop to it, or I don't know what we might not have come to.  </span><span id="en30319">That damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room—can you realise that?  </span><span id="en30321">You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you afterwards.  </span><span id="en30323">But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements.  </span><span id="en30325">You ask why I hadn't?  </span><span id="en30327">What shall I say to you?  </span><span id="en30329">it had all come upon me so suddenly.  </span><span id="en30331">I had scarcely sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).  </span><span id="en30333">An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see, Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en30335">Come, I thought—even if I let one thing slip for a time, I shall get hold of something else—I shan't lose what I want, anyway.  </span><span id="en30337">You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament; it's out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character, which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined.  </span><span id="en30339">Of course I did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and blurts out his whole story.  </span><span id="en30341">It does happen sometimes, if you make a man lose all patience, though even then it's rare.  </span><span id="en30343">I was capable of realising that.  </span><span id="en30345">If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not merely psychological.  </span><span id="en30347">For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed.  </span><span id="en30349">I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch, on your temperament above all things!  </span><span id="en30351">I had great hopes of you at that time." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30354">"But what are you driving at now?"  </span><span id="en30356">Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking the question without thinking. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30359">"What is he talking about?"  </span><span id="en30361">he wondered distractedly, "does he really take me to be innocent?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30364">"What am I driving at?  </span><span id="en30366">I've come to explain myself, I consider it my duty, so to speak.  </span><span id="en30368">I want to make clear to you how the whole business, the whole misunderstanding arose.  </span><span id="en30370">I've caused you a great deal of suffering, Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en30372">I am not a monster.  </span><span id="en30374">I understand what it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud, imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!  </span><span id="en30376">I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without elements of magnanimity, though I don't agree with all your convictions.  </span><span id="en30378">I wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above all I don't want to deceive you.  </span><span id="en30380">When I made your acquaintance, I felt attracted by you.  </span><span id="en30382">Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so.  </span><span id="en30384">You have a right to.  </span><span id="en30386">I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you've no reason to like me.  </span><span id="en30388">You may think what you like, but I desire now to do all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart and conscience.  </span><span id="en30390">I speak sincerely." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30393">Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause.  </span><span id="en30395">Raskolnikov felt a rush of renewed alarm.  </span><span id="en30397">The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent began to make him uneasy. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30400">"It's scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail," Porfiry Petrovitch went on. " </span><span id="en30402">Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it.  </span><span id="en30404">To begin with there were rumours.  </span><span id="en30406">Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to me...  </span><span id="en30408">and how they affected you, I need not go into.  </span><span id="en30410">My suspicions were aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have happened.  </span><span id="en30412">What was it?  </span><span id="en30414">Hm!  </span><span id="en30416">I believe there is no need to go into that either.  </span><span id="en30418">Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind.  </span><span id="en30420">I admit it openly—for one may as well make a clean breast of it—I was the first to pitch on you.  </span><span id="en30422">The old woman's notes on the pledges and the rest of it—that all came to nothing.  </span><span id="en30424">Yours was one of a hundred.  </span><span id="en30426">I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness.  </span><span id="en30428">It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!  </span><span id="en30430">How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas?  </span><span id="en30432">From a hundred rabbits you can't make a horse, a hundred suspicions don't make a proof, as the English proverb says, but that's only from the rational point of view—you can't help being partial, for after all a lawyer is only human.  </span><span id="en30434">I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you remember, on your first visit we talked of it?  </span><span id="en30436">I jeered at you at the time, but that was only to lead you on.  </span><span id="en30438">I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch, you are ill and impatient.  </span><span id="en30440">That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest and...  </span><span id="en30442">had felt a great deal I recognised long before.  </span><span id="en30444">I, too, have felt the same, so that your article seemed familiar to me.  </span><span id="en30446">It was conceived on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed enthusiasm.  </span><span id="en30448">And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is dangerous!  </span><span id="en30450">I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary amateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of youth.  </span><span id="en30452">There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist.  </span><span id="en30454">Your article is absurd and fantastic, but there's a transparent sincerity, a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it.  </span><span id="en30456">It's a gloomy article, but that's what's fine in it.  </span><span id="en30458">I read your article and put it aside, thinking as I did so 'that man won't go the common way. </span><span id="en30460">' Well, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being carried away by what followed?  </span><span id="en30462">Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I am not making any statement now.  </span><span id="en30464">I simply noted it at the time.  </span><span id="en30466">What is there in it?  </span><span id="en30468">I reflected.  </span><span id="en30470">There's nothing in it, that is really nothing and perhaps absolutely nothing.  </span><span id="en30472">And it's not at all the thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him—you may think what you like of it, but it's evidence.  </span><span id="en30474">He brings in his psychology, too; one has to consider him, too, for it's a matter of life and death.  </span><span id="en30476">Why am I explaining this to you?  </span><span id="en30478">That you may understand, and not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion.  </span><span id="en30480">It was not malicious, I assure you, he-he!  </span><span id="en30482">Do you suppose I didn't come to search your room at the time?  </span><span id="en30484">I did, I did, he-he!  </span><span id="en30486">I was here when you were lying ill in bed, not officially, not in my own person, but I was here.  </span><span id="en30487">Your room was searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but  </span><i><span id="en30488">umsonst </span></i><span id="en30490">! I thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and quickly, too; if he's guilty, he's sure to come.  </span><span id="en30492">Another man wouldn't, but he will.  </span><span id="en30494">And you remember how Mr.  </span><span id="en30496">Razumihin began discussing the subject with you?  </span><span id="en30498">We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread rumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a man to restrain his indignation.  </span><span id="en30500">Mr.  </span><span id="en30502">Zametov was tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring.  </span><span id="en30504">Think of blurting out in a restaurant 'I killed her. </span><span id="en30506">' It was too daring, too reckless.  </span><span id="en30508">I thought so myself, if he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent.  </span><span id="en30510">That was what I thought at the time.  </span><span id="en30512">I was expecting you.  </span><span id="en30514">But you simply bowled Zametov over and...  </span><span id="en30516">well, you see, it all lies in this—that this damnable psychology can be taken two ways!  </span><span id="en30518">Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you came!  </span><span id="en30520">My heart was fairly throbbing.  </span><span id="en30522">Ach! </span></p>
<p><span id="en30526">"Now, why need you have come?  </span><span id="en30528">Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you remember?  </span><span id="en30530">I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn't expected you so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter.  </span><span id="en30532">You see what influence a mood has!  </span><span id="en30534">Mr.  </span><span id="en30536">Razumihin then—ah, that stone, that stone under which the things were hidden!  </span><span id="en30538">I seem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden.  </span><span id="en30540">It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office?  </span><span id="en30542">And when we began picking your article to pieces, how you explained it!  </span><span id="en30544">One could take every word of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30547">"So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and knocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what I was about.  </span><span id="en30549">After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if you like, and it's more natural so, indeed.  </span><span id="en30551">I couldn't help admitting it was more natural.  </span><span id="en30553">I was bothered!  </span><span id="en30555">'No, I'd better get hold of some little fact' I said.  </span><span id="en30557">So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my breath and was all in a tremor.  </span><span id="en30559">'Here is my little fact,' thought I, and I didn't think it over, I simply wouldn't.  </span><span id="en30561">I would have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you walked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way.  </span><span id="en30563">And then what about your trembling, what about your bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium? </span></p>
<p><span id="en30566">"And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on you?  </span><span id="en30568">And what made you come at that very minute?  </span><span id="en30570">Someone seemed to have sent you, by Jove!  </span><span id="en30572">And if Nikolay had not parted us...  </span><span id="en30574">and do you remember Nikolay at the time?  </span><span id="en30576">Do you remember him clearly?  </span><span id="en30578">It was a thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt!  </span><span id="en30580">And how I met him!  </span><span id="en30582">I didn't believe in the thunderbolt, not for a minute.  </span><span id="en30584">You could see it for yourself; and how could I?  </span><span id="en30586">Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised at him myself, even then I didn't believe his story!  </span><span id="en30588">You see what it is to be as firm as a rock!  </span><span id="en30589">No, thought I,  </span><i><span id="en30590">Morgenfrüh </span></i><span id="en30592">. What has Nikolay got to do with it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30596">"Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had yourself assured him of it...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30599">His voice failed him, and he broke off.  </span><span id="en30601">He had been listening in indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through him, went back upon himself.  </span><span id="en30603">He was afraid of believing it and did not believe it.  </span><span id="en30605">In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for something more definite and conclusive. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30608">"Mr.  </span><span id="en30610">Razumihin!"  </span><span id="en30612">cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. " </span><span id="en30614">He-he-he!  </span><span id="en30616">But I had to put Mr.  </span><span id="en30618">Razumihin off; two is company, three is none.  </span><span id="en30620">Mr.  </span><span id="en30622">Razumihin is not the right man, besides he is an outsider.  </span><span id="en30624">He came running to me with a pale face....  </span><span id="en30626">But never mind him, why bring him in?  </span><span id="en30628">To return to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I understand him, that is?  </span><span id="en30630">To begin with, he is still a child and not exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist.  </span><span id="en30632">Really, don't laugh at my describing him so.  </span><span id="en30634">He is innocent and responsive to influence.  </span><span id="en30636">He has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow.  </span><span id="en30638">He sings and dances, he tells stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.  </span><span id="en30640">He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger to him; he will drink himself senseless—not as a regular vice, but at times, when people treat him, like a child.  </span><span id="en30642">And he stole, too, then, without knowing it himself, for 'How can it be stealing, if one picks it up? </span><span id="en30644">' And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter?  </span><span id="en30646">There have been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder.  </span><span id="en30648">I learnt all this from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers.  </span><span id="en30650">And what's more, he wanted to run into the wilderness!  </span><span id="en30652">He was full of fervour, prayed at night, read the old books, 'the true' ones, and read himself crazy. </span></p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"><span id="en30655">     [*] A religious sect. </span><span id="en30657">—TRANSLATOR'S NOTE. </span><br></div>
<p><span id="en30661">"Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the wine.  </span><span id="en30663">He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that.  </span><span id="en30665">I learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see him, and now this business came upon him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30668">"Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself!  </span><span id="en30670">He ran away!  </span><span id="en30672">How can one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings?  </span><span id="en30674">The very word 'trial' frightens some of them.  </span><span id="en30676">Whose fault is it?  </span><span id="en30678">We shall see what the new juries will do.  </span><span id="en30680">God grant they do good!  </span><span id="en30682">Well, in prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too, made its appearance again.  </span><span id="en30684">Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of the word 'suffering' among some of these people!  </span><span id="en30686">It's not a question of suffering for someone's benefit, but simply, 'one must suffer. </span><span id="en30688">' If they suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better.  </span><span id="en30690">In my time there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him no harm.  </span><span id="en30692">And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side on purpose, for fear of hurting him.  </span><span id="en30694">Well, we know what happens to a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon.  </span><span id="en30696">So 'he took his suffering. </span><span id="en30697">' </span></p>
<p><span id="en30699">"So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something of the sort.  </span><span id="en30701">I know it for certain from facts, indeed.  </span><span id="en30703">Only he doesn't know that I know.  </span><span id="en30705">What, you don't admit that there are such fantastic people among the peasants?  </span><span id="en30707">Lots of them.  </span><span id="en30709">The elder now has begun influencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself.  </span><span id="en30711">But he'll come and tell me all himself.  </span><span id="en30713">You think he'll hold out?  </span><span id="en30715">Wait a bit, he'll take his words back.  </span><span id="en30717">I am waiting from hour to hour for him to come and abjure his evidence.  </span><span id="en30719">I have come to like that Nikolay and am studying him in detail.  </span><span id="en30721">And what do you think?  </span><span id="en30723">He-he!  </span><span id="en30725">He answered me very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly.  </span><span id="en30727">But on other points he is simply at sea, knows nothing and doesn't even suspect that he doesn't know! </span></p>
<p><span id="en30730">"No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn't come in!  </span><span id="en30732">This is a fantastic, gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood 'renews,' when comfort is preached as the aim of life.  </span><span id="en30734">Here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories.  </span><span id="en30736">Here we see resolution in the first stage, but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime.  </span><span id="en30738">He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for a theory.  </span><span id="en30740">He committed the murder and couldn't take the money, and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone.  </span><span id="en30742">It wasn't enough for him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and rung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to recall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....  </span><span id="en30744">Well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others, poses as injured innocence.  </span><span id="en30746">No, that's not the work of a Nikolay, my dear Rodion Romanovitch!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30749">All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that these words were too great a shock.  </span><span id="en30751">Raskolnikov shuddered as though he had been stabbed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30754">"Then...  </span><span id="en30756">who then...  </span><span id="en30758">is the murderer?"  </span><span id="en30760">he asked in a breathless voice, unable to restrain himself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30763">Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at the question. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30766">"Who is the murderer?"  </span><span id="en30768">he repeated, as though unable to believe his ears. " </span><span id="en30769">Why,  </span><i><span id="en30770">you </span></i><span id="en30772">, Rodion Romanovitch!  </span><span id="en30774">You are the murderer," he added, almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30778">Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down again without uttering a word.  </span><span id="en30780">His face twitched convulsively. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30783">"Your lip is twitching just as it did before," Porfiry Petrovitch observed almost sympathetically. " </span><span id="en30785">You've been misunderstanding me, I think, Rodion Romanovitch," he added after a brief pause, "that's why you are so surprised.  </span><span id="en30787">I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly with you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30790">"It was not I murdered her," Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened child caught in the act. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30793">"No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else," Porfiry whispered sternly, with conviction. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30796">They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten minutes.  </span><span id="en30798">Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers through his hair.  </span><span id="en30800">Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting.  </span><span id="en30802">Suddenly Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30805">"You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch!  </span><span id="en30807">Your old method again.  </span><span id="en30809">I wonder you don't get sick of it!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30812">"Oh, stop that, what does that matter now?  </span><span id="en30814">It would be a different matter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone.  </span><span id="en30816">You see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.  </span><span id="en30818">Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am convinced without it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30821">"If so, what did you come for?"  </span><span id="en30823">Raskolnikov asked irritably. " </span><span id="en30825">I ask you the same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don't you take me to prison?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30828">"Oh, that's your question!  </span><span id="en30830">I will answer you, point for point.  </span><span id="en30832">In the first place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30835">"How so?  </span><span id="en30837">If you are convinced you ought...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30840">"Ach, what if I am convinced?  </span><span id="en30842">That's only my dream for the time.  </span><span id="en30844">Why should I put you in safety?  </span><span id="en30846">You know that's it, since you ask me to do it.  </span><span id="en30848">If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him 'were you drunk or not?  </span><span id="en30850">Who saw me with you?  </span><span id="en30852">I simply took you to be drunk, and you were drunk, too. </span><span id="en30854">' Well, what could I answer, especially as your story is a more likely one than his?  </span><span id="en30856">for there's nothing but psychology to support his evidence—that's almost unseemly with his ugly mug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate drunkard and notoriously so.  </span><span id="en30858">And I have myself admitted candidly several times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the second way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from that I have as yet nothing against you.  </span><span id="en30860">And though I shall put you in prison and indeed have come—quite contrary to etiquette—to inform you of it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette, that it won't be to my advantage.  </span><span id="en30862">Well, secondly, I've come to you because..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30865">"Yes, yes, secondly?"  </span><span id="en30867">Raskolnikov was listening breathless. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30870">"Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation.  </span><span id="en30872">I don't want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking for you, you may believe me or not.  </span><span id="en30874">And in the third place I've come to you with a direct and open proposition—that you should surrender and confess.  </span><span id="en30876">It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too, for my task will be done.  </span><span id="en30878">Well, is this open on my part or not?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30881">Raskolnikov thought a minute. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30884">"Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en30886">You said just now you have nothing but psychology to go on, yet now you've gone on mathematics.  </span><span id="en30888">Well, what if you are mistaken yourself, now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30891">"No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken.  </span><span id="en30893">I have a little fact even then, Providence sent it me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30896">"What little fact?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30899">"I won't tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en30901">And in any case, I haven't the right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you.  </span><span id="en30902">So think it over: it makes no difference to me  </span><i><span id="en30903">now </span></i><span id="en30904">  </span><span id="en30905">and so I speak only for your sake.  </span><span id="en30907">Believe me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30911">Raskolnikov smiled malignantly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30914">"That's not simply ridiculous, it's positively shameless.  </span><span id="en30916">Why, even if I were guilty, which I don't admit, what reason should I have to confess, when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30919">"Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don't put too much faith in words, perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place.  </span><span id="en30921">That's only theory and my theory, and what authority am I for you?  </span><span id="en30923">Perhaps, too, even now I am hiding something from you?  </span><span id="en30925">I can't lay bare everything, he-he!  </span><span id="en30927">And how can you ask what advantage?  </span><span id="en30929">Don't you know how it would lessen your sentence?  </span><span id="en30931">You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case.  </span><span id="en30933">Consider that!  </span><span id="en30935">I swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall come as a complete surprise.  </span><span id="en30937">We will make a clean sweep of all these psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it was an aberration.  </span><span id="en30939">I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep my word." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30942">Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink dejectedly.  </span><span id="en30944">He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his smile was sad and gentle. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30947">"No!"  </span><span id="en30949">he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances with Porfiry, "it's not worth it, I don't care about lessening the sentence!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30952">"That's just what I was afraid of!"  </span><span id="en30954">Porfiry cried warmly and, as it seemed, involuntarily. " </span><span id="en30956">That's just what I feared, that you wouldn't care about the mitigation of sentence." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30959">Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30962">"Ah, don't disdain life!"  </span><span id="en30964">Porfiry went on. " </span><span id="en30966">You have a great deal of it still before you.  </span><span id="en30968">How can you say you don't want a mitigation of sentence?  </span><span id="en30970">You are an impatient fellow!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30973">"A great deal of what lies before me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en30976">"Of life.  </span><span id="en30978">What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it?  </span><span id="en30980">Seek and ye shall find.  </span><span id="en30982">This may be God's means for bringing you to Him.  </span><span id="en30984">And it's not for ever, the bondage...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en30987">"The time will be shortened," laughed Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en30990">"Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of?  </span><span id="en30992">It may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young!  </span><span id="en30993">But anyway  </span><i><span id="en30994">you </span></i><span id="en30995">  </span><span id="en30996">shouldn't be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31000">"Ach, hang it!"  </span><span id="en31002">Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as though he did not want to speak aloud. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31005">He got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in evident despair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31008">"Hang it, if you like!  </span><span id="en31010">You've lost faith and you think that I am grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been?  </span><span id="en31012">How much do you understand?  </span><span id="en31014">You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original!  </span><span id="en31016">It turned out something base, that's true, but you are not hopelessly base.  </span><span id="en31018">By no means so base!  </span><span id="en31020">At least you didn't deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the furthest point at one bound.  </span><span id="en31022">How do I regard you?  </span><span id="en31024">I regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts their entrails out, if only they have found faith or God.  </span><span id="en31026">Find it and you will live.  </span><span id="en31028">You have long needed a change of air.  </span><span id="en31030">Suffering, too, is a good thing.  </span><span id="en31032">Suffer!  </span><span id="en31034">Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.  </span><span id="en31036">I know you don't believe in it—but don't be over-wise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don't be afraid—the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again.  </span><span id="en31038">What bank?  </span><span id="en31040">How can I tell?  </span><span id="en31042">I only believe that you have long life before you.  </span><span id="en31044">I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared beforehand, but maybe you will remember them after.  </span><span id="en31046">They may be of use some time.  </span><span id="en31048">That's why I speak.  </span><span id="en31050">It's as well that you only killed the old woman.  </span><span id="en31052">If you'd invented another theory you might perhaps have done something a thousand times more hideous.  </span><span id="en31054">You ought to thank God, perhaps.  </span><span id="en31056">How do you know?  </span><span id="en31058">Perhaps God is saving you for something.  </span><span id="en31060">But keep a good heart and have less fear!  </span><span id="en31062">Are you afraid of the great expiation before you?  </span><span id="en31064">No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it.  </span><span id="en31066">Since you have taken such a step, you must harden your heart.  </span><span id="en31068">There is justice in it.  </span><span id="en31070">You must fulfil the demands of justice.  </span><span id="en31072">I know that you don't believe it, but indeed, life will bring you through.  </span><span id="en31074">You will live it down in time.  </span><span id="en31076">What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31079">Raskolnikov positively started. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31082">"But who are you?  </span><span id="en31084">what prophet are you?  </span><span id="en31086">From the height of what majestic calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31089">"Who am I?  </span><span id="en31091">I am a man with nothing to hope for, that's all.  </span><span id="en31093">A man perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day is over.  </span><span id="en31095">But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.  </span><span id="en31097">Though, who knows?  </span><span id="en31099">maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come to nothing.  </span><span id="en31101">Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another class of men?  </span><span id="en31103">It's not comfort you regret, with your heart!  </span><span id="en31105">What of it that perhaps no one will see you for so long?  </span><span id="en31107">It's not time, but yourself that will decide that.  </span><span id="en31109">Be the sun and all will see you.  </span><span id="en31111">The sun has before all to be the sun.  </span><span id="en31113">Why are you smiling again?  </span><span id="en31115">At my being such a Schiller?  </span><span id="en31117">I bet you're imagining that I am trying to get round you by flattery.  </span><span id="en31119">Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he!  </span><span id="en31121">Perhaps you'd better not believe my word, perhaps you'd better never believe it altogether—I'm made that way, I confess it.  </span><span id="en31123">But let me add, you can judge for yourself, I think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31126">"When do you mean to arrest me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31129">"Well, I can let you walk about another day or two.  </span><span id="en31131">Think it over, my dear fellow, and pray to God.  </span><span id="en31133">It's more in your interest, believe me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31136">"And what if I run away?"  </span><span id="en31138">asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31141">"No, you won't run away.  </span><span id="en31143">A peasant would run away, a fashionable dissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man's thought, for you've only to show him the end of your little finger and he'll be ready to believe in anything for the rest of his life.  </span><span id="en31145">But you've ceased to believe in your theory already, what will you run away with?  </span><span id="en31147">And what would you do in hiding?  </span><span id="en31149">It would be hateful and difficult for you, and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an atmosphere to suit you.  </span><span id="en31151">And what sort of atmosphere would you have?  </span><span id="en31153">If you ran away, you'd come back to yourself.  </span><i><span id="en31156">You can't get on without us. </span></i><span id="en31158">  </span><span id="en31159">And if I put you in prison—say you've been there a month, or two, or three—remember my word, you'll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise.  </span><span id="en31161">You won't know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession.  </span><span id="en31163">I am convinced that you will decide, 'to take your suffering. </span><span id="en31165">' You don't believe my words now, but you'll come to it of yourself.  </span><span id="en31167">For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing.  </span><span id="en31169">Never mind my having grown fat, I know all the same.  </span><span id="en31171">Don't laugh at it, there's an idea in suffering, Nokolay is right.  </span><span id="en31173">No, you won't run away, Rodion Romanovitch." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31179">Raskolnikov got up and took his cap.  </span><span id="en31181">Porfiry Petrovitch also rose. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31184">"Are you going for a walk?  </span><span id="en31186">The evening will be fine, if only we don't have a storm.  </span><span id="en31188">Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31191">He, too, took his cap. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31194">"Porfiry Petrovitch, please don't take up the notion that I have confessed to you to-day," Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence. " </span><span id="en31196">You're a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.  </span><span id="en31198">But I have admitted nothing, remember that!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31201">"Oh, I know that, I'll remember.  </span><span id="en31203">Look at him, he's trembling!  </span><span id="en31205">Don't be uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way.  </span><span id="en31207">Walk about a bit, you won't be able to walk too far.  </span><span id="en31209">If anything happens, I have one request to make of you," he added, dropping his voice. " </span><span id="en31211">It's an awkward one, but important.  </span><span id="en31213">If anything were to happen (though indeed I don't believe in it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion—laying hands on yourself—(it's an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the stone.  </span><span id="en31215">It will be more generous.  </span><span id="en31217">Come, till we meet!  </span><span id="en31219">Good thoughts and sound decisions to you!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31222">Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov.  </span><span id="en31224">The latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away.  </span><span id="en31226">Then he too went hurriedly out of the room. </span></p>

<p><span id="en31230">He hurried to Svidrigaïlov's.  </span><span id="en31232">What he had to hope from that man he did not know.  </span><span id="en31234">But that man had some hidden power over him.  </span><span id="en31236">Having once recognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31239">On the way, one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigaïlov been to Porfiry's? </span></p>
<p><span id="en31242">As far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not.  </span><span id="en31244">He pondered again and again, went over Porfiry's visit; no, he hadn't been, of course he hadn't. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31247">But if he had not been yet, would he go?  </span><span id="en31249">Meanwhile, for the present he fancied he couldn't.  </span><span id="en31251">Why?  </span><span id="en31253">He could not have explained, but if he could, he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment.  </span><span id="en31255">It all worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it.  </span><span id="en31257">Strange to say, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague anxiety about his immediate future.  </span><span id="en31259">Another, much more important anxiety tormented him—it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.  </span><span id="en31261">Moreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was working better that morning than it had done of late. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31264">And was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with these new trivial difficulties?  </span><span id="en31266">Was it worth while, for instance, to manoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry's?  </span><span id="en31268">Was it worth while to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone like Svidrigaïlov? </span></p>
<p><span id="en31271">Oh, how sick he was of it all! </span></p>
<p><span id="en31273">And yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be expecting something  </span><i><span id="en31274">new </span></i><span id="en31275">  </span><span id="en31276">from him, information, or means of escape?  </span><span id="en31278">Men will catch at straws!  </span><span id="en31280">Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?  </span><span id="en31282">Perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov but some other whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented himself by chance.  </span><span id="en31284">Sonia?  </span><span id="en31286">But what should he go to Sonia for now?  </span><span id="en31288">To beg her tears again?  </span><span id="en31290">He was afraid of Sonia, too.  </span><span id="en31292">Sonia stood before him as an irrevocable sentence.  </span><span id="en31294">He must go his own way or hers.  </span><span id="en31296">At that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her.  </span><span id="en31298">No, would it not be better to try Svidrigaïlov?  </span><span id="en31300">And he could not help inwardly owning that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31304">But what could they have in common?  </span><span id="en31306">Their very evil-doing could not be of the same kind.  </span><span id="en31308">The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently depraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant.  </span><span id="en31310">Such stories were told about him.  </span><span id="en31312">It is true he was befriending Katerina Ivanovna's children, but who could tell with what motive and what it meant?  </span><span id="en31314">The man always had some design, some project. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31317">There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late about Raskolnikov's mind, and causing him great uneasiness.  </span><span id="en31319">It was so painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it.  </span><span id="en31321">He sometimes thought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps.  </span><span id="en31323">Svidrigaïlov had found out his secret and had had designs on Dounia.  </span><span id="en31325">What if he had them still?  </span><span id="en31327">Wasn't it practically certain that he had?  </span><span id="en31329">And what if, having learnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it as a weapon against Dounia? </span></p>
<p><span id="en31332">This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en31334">The very thought moved him to gloomy rage.  </span><span id="en31336">To begin with, this would transform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to confess his secret to Dounia.  </span><span id="en31338">Would he have to give himself up perhaps to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step?  </span><span id="en31340">The letter?  </span><span id="en31342">This morning Dounia had received a letter.  </span><span id="en31344">From whom could she get letters in Petersburg?  </span><span id="en31346">Luzhin, perhaps?  </span><span id="en31348">It's true Razumihin was there to protect her, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position.  </span><span id="en31350">Perhaps it was his duty to tell Razumihin?  </span><span id="en31352">He thought of it with repugnance. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31355">In any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decided finally.  </span><span id="en31357">Thank God, the details of the interview were of little consequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but if Svidrigaïlov were capable...  </span><span id="en31359">if he were intriguing against Dounia—then... </span></p>
<p><span id="en31362">Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month that he could only decide such questions in one way; "then I shall kill him," he thought in cold despair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31365">A sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he was going.  </span><span id="en31367">He found himself in X.  </span><span id="en31369">Prospect, thirty or forty paces from the Hay Market, through which he had come.  </span><span id="en31371">The whole second storey of the house on the left was used as a tavern.  </span><span id="en31373">All the windows were wide open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were full to overflowing.  </span><span id="en31375">There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum.  </span><span id="en31377">He could hear women shrieking.  </span><span id="en31379">He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X.  </span><span id="en31381">Prospect, when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.  </span><span id="en31383">Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified.  </span><span id="en31385">Svidrigaïlov was silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.  </span><span id="en31387">Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.  </span><span id="en31389">His heart was beating violently.  </span><span id="en31391">Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen.  </span><span id="en31393">He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen him, and was watching him.  </span><span id="en31395">What had passed between them was much the same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room.  </span><span id="en31397">A sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov's face and grew broader and broader.  </span><span id="en31399">Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other.  </span><span id="en31401">At last Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31404">"Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!"  </span><span id="en31406">he shouted from the window. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31409">Raskolnikov went up into the tavern.  </span><span id="en31411">He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singers.  </span><span id="en31413">The click of billiard balls could be heard in the distance.  </span><span id="en31415">On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne.  </span><span id="en31417">In the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons.  </span><span id="en31419">In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some servants' hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of the organ. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31422">"Come, that's enough," Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov's entrance.  </span><span id="en31424">The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.  </span><span id="en31426">She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful expression in her face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31429">"Hey, Philip, a glass!"  </span><span id="en31431">shouted Svidrigaïlov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31434">"I won't drink anything," said Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31437">"As you like, I didn't mean it for you.  </span><span id="en31439">Drink, Katia!  </span><span id="en31441">I don't want anything more to-day, you can go."  </span><span id="en31443">He poured her out a full glass, and laid down a yellow note. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31446">Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down, in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov's hand, which he allowed quite seriously.  </span><span id="en31448">She went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with the organ.  </span><span id="en31450">Both had been brought in from the street.  </span><span id="en31452">Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip, was by now an old friend and very obsequious. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31455">The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it.  </span><span id="en31457">Svidrigaïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it.  </span><span id="en31459">The tavern was dirty and wretched, not even second-rate. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31462">"I was going to see you and looking for you," Raskolnikov began, "but I don't know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X.  </span><span id="en31464">Prospect just now.  </span><span id="en31466">I never take this turning.  </span><span id="en31468">I turn to the right from the Hay Market.  </span><span id="en31470">And this isn't the way to you.  </span><span id="en31472">I simply turned and here you are.  </span><span id="en31474">It is strange!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31477">"Why don't you say at once 'it's a miracle'?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31480">"Because it may be only chance." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31483">"Oh, that's the way with all you folk," laughed Svidrigaïlov. " </span><span id="en31485">You won't admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle!  </span><span id="en31487">Here you say that it may be only chance.  </span><span id="en31489">And what cowards they all are here, about having an opinion of their own, you can't fancy, Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en31491">I don't mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it.  </span><span id="en31493">That's how it was you attracted my curiosity." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31496">"Nothing else?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31499">"Well, that's enough, you know," Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated, but only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31502">"I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having what you call an opinion of my own," observed Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31505">"Oh, well, it was a different matter.  </span><span id="en31507">Everyone has his own plans.  </span><span id="en31509">And apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep for the last two or three days.  </span><span id="en31511">I told you of this tavern myself, there is no miracle in your coming straight here.  </span><span id="en31513">I explained the way myself, told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here.  </span><span id="en31515">Do you remember?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31518">"I don't remember," answered Raskolnikov with surprise. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31521">"I believe you.  </span><span id="en31523">I told you twice.  </span><span id="en31525">The address has been stamped mechanically on your memory.  </span><span id="en31527">You turned this way mechanically and yet precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of it.  </span><span id="en31529">When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me.  </span><span id="en31531">You give yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en31533">And another thing, I'm convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves as they walk.  </span><span id="en31535">This is a town of crazy people.  </span><span id="en31537">If only we had scientific men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable investigations in Petersburg each in his own line.  </span><span id="en31539">There are few places where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul of man as in Petersburg.  </span><span id="en31541">The mere influences of climate mean so much.  </span><span id="en31543">And it's the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must be reflected on the whole country.  </span><span id="en31545">But that is neither here nor there now.  </span><span id="en31547">The point is that I have several times watched you.  </span><span id="en31549">You walk out of your house—holding your head high—twenty paces from home you let it sink, and fold your hands behind your back.  </span><span id="en31551">You look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you.  </span><span id="en31553">At last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at last stand still in the middle of the road.  </span><span id="en31555">That's not at all the thing.  </span><span id="en31557">Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won't do you any good.  </span><span id="en31559">It's nothing really to do with me and I can't cure you, but, of course, you understand me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31562">"Do you know that I am being followed?"  </span><span id="en31564">asked Raskolnikov, looking inquisitively at him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31567">"No, I know nothing about it," said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31570">"Well, then, let us leave me alone," Raskolnikov muttered, frowning. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31573">"Very good, let us leave you alone." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31576">"You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just now when I looked at the window from the street?  </span><span id="en31578">I saw it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31581">"He-he!  </span><span id="en31583">And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and pretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your doorway?  </span><span id="en31585">I saw it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31588">"I may have had...  </span><span id="en31590">reasons.  </span><span id="en31592">You know that yourself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31595">"And I may have had my reasons, though you don't know them." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31598">Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en31600">For a full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before.  </span><span id="en31602">It was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips, with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair.  </span><span id="en31604">His eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed.  </span><span id="en31606">There was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so wonderfully young for his age.  </span><span id="en31608">Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen.  </span><span id="en31610">He wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31613">"Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?"  </span><span id="en31615">said Raskolnikov suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. " </span><span id="en31617">Even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me, I don't want to put myself out any more.  </span><span id="en31619">I will show you at once that I don't prize myself as you probably think I do.  </span><span id="en31621">I've come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.  </span><span id="en31623">You can reckon on my word.  </span><span id="en31625">You know that I can keep it.  </span><span id="en31627">And in the second place if you want to tell me anything—for I keep fancying all this time that you have something to tell me—make haste and tell it, for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31630">"Why in such haste?"  </span><span id="en31632">asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31635">"Everyone has his plans," Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31638">"You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question you refuse to answer," Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile. " </span><span id="en31640">You keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with suspicion.  </span><span id="en31642">Of course it's perfectly natural in your position.  </span><span id="en31644">But though I should like to be friends with you, I shan't trouble myself to convince you of the contrary.  </span><span id="en31646">The game isn't worth the candle and I wasn't intending to talk to you about anything special." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31649">"What did you want me, for, then?  </span><span id="en31651">It was you who came hanging about me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31654">"Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation.  </span><span id="en31656">I liked the fantastic nature of your position—that's what it was!  </span><span id="en31658">Besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn't that enough?  </span><span id="en31660">Ha-ha-ha!  </span><span id="en31662">Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and is difficult for me to answer.  </span><span id="en31664">Here, you, for instance, have come to me not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something new.  </span><span id="en31666">Isn't that so?  </span><span id="en31668">Isn't that so?"  </span><span id="en31670">persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly smile. " </span><span id="en31672">Well, can't you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my making some profit out of you!  </span><span id="en31674">You see what rich men we are!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31677">"What profit could you make?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31680">"How can I tell you?  </span><span id="en31682">How do I know?  </span><span id="en31684">You see in what a tavern I spend all my time and it's my enjoyment, that's to say it's no great enjoyment, but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now—you saw her?...  </span><span id="en31686">If only I had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31689">He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31692">"Have you dined, by the way?  </span><span id="en31694">I've had something and want nothing more.  </span><span id="en31696">I don't drink, for instance, at all.  </span><span id="en31698">Except for champagne I never touch anything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even that is enough to make my head ache.  </span><span id="en31700">I ordered it just now to wind myself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind.  </span><span id="en31702">That was why I hid myself just now like a schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me.  </span><span id="en31704">But I believe," he pulled out his watch, "I can spend an hour with you.  </span><span id="en31706">It's half-past four now.  </span><span id="en31708">If only I'd been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry officer, a photographer, a journalist...  </span><span id="en31710">I am nothing, no specialty, and sometimes I am positively bored.  </span><span id="en31712">I really thought you would tell me something new." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31715">"But what are you, and why have you come here?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31718">"What am I?  </span><span id="en31720">You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the cavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa Petrovna and lived in the country.  </span><span id="en31722">There you have my biography!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31725">"You are a gambler, I believe?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31728">"No, a poor sort of gambler.  </span><span id="en31730">A card-sharper—not a gambler." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31733">"You have been a card-sharper then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31736">"Yes, I've been a card-sharper too." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31739">"Didn't you get thrashed sometimes?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31742">"It did happen.  </span><span id="en31744">Why?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31747">"Why, you might have challenged them...  </span><span id="en31749">altogether it must have been lively." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31752">"I won't contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy.  </span><span id="en31754">I confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31757">"As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31760">"Quite so," Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. " </span><span id="en31762">What of it?  </span><span id="en31764">You seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31767">"You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31770">"Vice!  </span><span id="en31772">Oh, that's what you are after!  </span><span id="en31774">But I'll answer you in order, first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking.  </span><span id="en31776">Tell me, what should I restrain myself for?  </span><span id="en31778">Why should I give up women, since I have a passion for them?  </span><span id="en31780">It's an occupation, anyway." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31783">"So you hope for nothing here but vice?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31786">"Oh, very well, for vice then.  </span><span id="en31788">You insist on its being vice.  </span><span id="en31790">But anyway I like a direct question.  </span><span id="en31792">In this vice at least there is something permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy, something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even with years.  </span><span id="en31794">You'll agree it's an occupation of a sort." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31797">"That's nothing to rejoice at, it's a disease and a dangerous one." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31800">"Oh, that's what you think, is it!  </span><span id="en31802">I agree, that it is a disease like everything that exceeds moderation.  </span><span id="en31804">And, of course, in this one must exceed moderation.  </span><span id="en31806">But in the first place, everybody does so in one way or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate and prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do?  </span><span id="en31808">If I hadn't this, I might have to shoot myself.  </span><span id="en31810">I am ready to admit that a decent man ought to put up with being bored, but yet..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31813">"And could you shoot yourself?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31816">"Oh, come!"  </span><span id="en31818">Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. " </span><span id="en31820">Please don't speak of it," he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversation.  </span><span id="en31822">His face quite changed. " </span><span id="en31824">I admit it's an unpardonable weakness, but I can't help it.  </span><span id="en31826">I am afraid of death and I dislike its being talked of.  </span><span id="en31828">Do you know that I am to a certain extent a mystic?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31831">"Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna!  </span><span id="en31833">Do they still go on visiting you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31836">"Oh, don't talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound them!"  </span><span id="en31838">he cried with an air of irritation. " </span><span id="en31840">Let's rather talk of that...  </span><span id="en31842">though...  </span><span id="en31844">H'm!  </span><span id="en31846">I have not much time, and can't stay long with you, it's a pity!  </span><span id="en31848">I should have found plenty to tell you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31851">"What's your engagement, a woman?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31854">"Yes, a woman, a casual incident....  </span><span id="en31856">No, that's not what I want to talk of." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31859">"And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn't that affect you?  </span><span id="en31861">Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en31864">"And do you pretend to strength, too?  </span><span id="en31866">He-he-he!  </span><span id="en31868">You surprised me just now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.  </span><span id="en31870">You preach to me about vice and æsthetics!  </span><span id="en31872">You—a Schiller, you—an idealist!  </span><span id="en31874">Of course that's all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality....  </span><span id="en31876">Ah, what a pity I have no time, for you're a most interesting type!  </span><span id="en31878">And, by-the-way, are you fond of Schiller?  </span><span id="en31880">I am awfully fond of him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31883">"But what a braggart you are," Raskolnikov said with some disgust. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31886">"Upon my word, I am not," answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. " </span><span id="en31888">However, I won't dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no one?  </span><span id="en31890">I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I come across an intelligent person like you—intelligent and highly interesting—I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I've drunk that half-glass of champagne and it's gone to my head a little.  </span><span id="en31892">And besides, there's a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that I...  </span><span id="en31894">will keep quiet.  </span><span id="en31896">Where are you off to?"  </span><span id="en31898">he asked in alarm. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31901">Raskolnikov had begun getting up.  </span><span id="en31903">He felt oppressed and stifled and, as it were, ill at ease at having come here.  </span><span id="en31905">He felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth. </span></p>
<p><span id="en31908">"A-ach!  </span><span id="en31910">Sit down, stay a little!"  </span><span id="en31912">Svidrigaïlov begged. " </span><span id="en31914">Let them bring you some tea, anyway.  </span><span id="en31916">Stay a little, I won't talk nonsense, about myself, I mean.  </span><span id="en31918">I'll tell you something.  </span><span id="en31920">If you like I'll tell you how a woman tried 'to save' me, as you would call it?  </span><span id="en31922">It will be an answer to your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister.  </span><span id="en31924">May I tell you?  </span><span id="en31926">It will help to spend the time." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31929">"Tell me, but I trust that you..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en31932">"Oh, don't be uneasy.  </span><span id="en31934">Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me, Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect." </span></p>

<p><span id="en31938">"You know perhaps—yes, I told you myself," began Svidrigaïlov, "that I was in the debtors' prison here, for an immense sum, and had not any expectation of being able to pay it.  </span><span id="en31940">There's no need to go into particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a point of insanity a woman can sometimes love?  </span><span id="en31942">She was an honest woman, and very sensible, although completely uneducated.  </span><span id="en31944">Would you believe that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept throughout our married life?  </span><span id="en31946">She was considerably older than I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth.  </span><span id="en31948">There was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to tell her straight out that I couldn't be absolutely faithful to her.  </span><span id="en31950">This confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have liked my brutal frankness.  </span><span id="en31952">She thought it showed I was unwilling to deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous woman, you know, that's the first consideration.  </span><span id="en31954">After many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of our class; sixthly, in case I—which God forbid—should be visited by a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna.  </span><span id="en31956">On this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease.  </span><span id="en31958">She was a sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real love.  </span><span id="en31960">But a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two very different things, and that's where the trouble came in.  </span><span id="en31962">But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people about us.  </span><span id="en31964">I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyone's.  </span><span id="en31966">Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna.  </span><span id="en31968">She certainly had some very ridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the innumerable woes of which I was the cause.  </span><span id="en31969">Well, and that's enough, I think, by way of a decorous  </span><i><span id="en31970">oraison funèbre </span></i><span id="en31971">  </span><span id="en31972">for the most tender wife of a most tender husband.  </span><span id="en31974">When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed.  </span><span id="en31976">These were times when she was positively proud of me.  </span><span id="en31978">But your sister she couldn't put up with, anyway.  </span><span id="en31980">And however she came to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house as a governess.  </span><span id="en31982">My explanation is that Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love herself—literally fell in love—with your sister.  </span><span id="en31984">Well, little wonder—look at Avdotya Romanovna!  </span><span id="en31986">I saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even.  </span><span id="en31988">But Avdotya Romanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it?  </span><span id="en31990">Would you believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en31992">I don't know what it was she wanted!  </span><span id="en31994">Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya Romanovna every detail about me.  </span><span id="en31996">She had the unfortunate habit of telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful new friend?  </span><span id="en31998">I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were current about me....  </span><span id="en32000">I don't mind betting that you too have heard something of the sort already?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32004">"I have.  </span><span id="en32006">Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child.  </span><span id="en32008">Is that true?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32011">"Don't refer to those vulgar tales, I beg," said Svidrigaïlov with disgust and annoyance. " </span><span id="en32013">If you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy, I will tell you one day, but now..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32016">"I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you treated badly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32019">"I beg you to drop the subject," Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with obvious impatience. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32022">"Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...  </span><span id="en32024">you told me about it yourself."  </span><span id="en32026">Raskolnikov felt more and more irritated. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32029">Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look.  </span><span id="en32030">But Svidrigaïlov restrained himself and answered very civilly: </span></p>
<p><span id="en32032">"Yes, it was.  </span><span id="en32034">I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity.  </span><span id="en32036">Upon my soul!  </span><span id="en32038">I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with some people.  </span><span id="en32040">Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me.  </span><span id="en32042">I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any case it worked in my interests.  </span><span id="en32044">With all Avdotya Romanovna's natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect—she did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul.  </span><span id="en32045">And if once a girl's heart is moved to  </span><i><span id="en32046">pity </span></i><span id="en32048">, it's more dangerous than anything.  </span><span id="en32050">She is bound to want to 'save him,' to bring him to his senses, and lift him up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and usefulness—well, we all know how far such dreams can go.  </span><span id="en32052">I saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage of herself.  </span><span id="en32054">And I too made ready.  </span><span id="en32056">I think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch?  </span><span id="en32058">There's no need.  </span><span id="en32060">As you know, it all ended in smoke.  </span><span id="en32062">(Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking! </span><span id="en32064">) Do you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn't your sister's fate to be born in the second or third century A. </span><span id="en32066">D. </span><span id="en32068">, as the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia Minor.  </span><span id="en32070">She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot pincers.  </span><span id="en32072">And she would have gone to it of herself.  </span><span id="en32074">And in the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and visions.  </span><span id="en32076">She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and if she can't get her torture, she'll throw herself out of a window.  </span><span id="en32078">I've heard something of a Mr.  </span><span id="en32080">Razumihin—he's said to be a sensible fellow; his surname suggests it, indeed.  </span><span id="en32082">He's probably a divinity student.  </span><span id="en32084">Well, he'd better look after your sister!  </span><span id="en32086">I believe I understand her, and I am proud of it.  </span><span id="en32088">But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one is apt to be more heedless and stupid.  </span><span id="en32090">One doesn't see clearly.  </span><span id="en32092">Hang it all, why is she so handsome?  </span><span id="en32094">It's not my fault.  </span><span id="en32096">In fact, it began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire.  </span><span id="en32098">Avdotya Romanovna is awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so.  </span><span id="en32100">Take note, I tell you this about your sister as a fact.  </span><span id="en32102">She is almost morbidly chaste, in spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way.  </span><span id="en32104">There happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed wench, whom I had never seen before—she had just come from another village—very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears, wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.  </span><span id="en32105">One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eyes  </span><i><span id="en32106">insisted </span></i><span id="en32107">  </span><span id="en32108">on my leaving poor Parasha alone.  </span><span id="en32110">It was almost our first conversation by ourselves.  </span><span id="en32112">I, of course, was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted, embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly.  </span><span id="en32114">Then came interviews, mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even tears—would you believe it, even tears?  </span><span id="en32116">Think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girls to!  </span><span id="en32118">I, of course, threw it all on my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one.  </span><span id="en32120">It's the well-known resource—flattery.  </span><span id="en32122">Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery.  </span><span id="en32124">If there's the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble.  </span><span id="en32126">But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction.  </span><span id="en32128">It may be a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction.  </span><span id="en32130">And however coarse the flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true.  </span><span id="en32132">That's so for all stages of development and classes of society.  </span><span id="en32134">A vestal virgin might be seduced by flattery.  </span><span id="en32136">I can never remember without laughter how I once seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her principles.  </span><span id="en32138">What fun it was and how little trouble!  </span><span id="en32140">And the lady really had principles—of her own, anyway.  </span><span id="en32142">All my tactics lay in simply being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity.  </span><span id="en32144">I flattered her shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.  </span><span id="en32146">I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on.  </span><span id="en32148">In fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite by accident.  </span><span id="en32150">And how angry she was with me when I explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was just as eager as I.  </span><span id="en32152">Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property settled on me during her lifetime.  </span><span id="en32154">(I am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much. </span><span id="en32156">) I hope you won't be angry if I mention now that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en32158">But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all.  </span><span id="en32160">Avdotya Romanovna had several times—and one time in particular—been greatly displeased by the expression of my eyes, would you believe it?  </span><span id="en32162">There was sometimes a light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her.  </span><span id="en32164">No need to go into detail, but we parted.  </span><span id="en32166">There I acted stupidly again.  </span><span id="en32168">I fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a tremendous to-do.  </span><span id="en32170">Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your sister's eyes can flash sometimes!  </span><span id="en32172">Never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine.  </span><span id="en32174">I am speaking the truth.  </span><span id="en32176">I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of her dress was more than I could stand at last.  </span><span id="en32178">I really began to think that I might become epileptic.  </span><span id="en32180">I could never have believed that I could be moved to such a frenzy.  </span><span id="en32182">It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled, but by then it was impossible.  </span><span id="en32184">And imagine what I did then!  </span><span id="en32186">To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy!  </span><span id="en32188">Never undertake anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en32190">I reflected that Avdotya Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that's not the word...  </span><span id="en32192">but does it matter if it expresses the meaning? </span><span id="en32194">), that she lived by her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money—thirty thousand roubles I could have realised then—if she would run away with me here, to Petersburg.  </span><span id="en32196">Of course I should have vowed eternal love, rapture, and so on.  </span><span id="en32198">Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat and to marry herself, it would have been done at once!  </span><span id="en32200">But it ended in the catastrophe of which you know already.  </span><span id="en32202">You can fancy how frantic I was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them—which would really have been just the same thing as I was proposing.  </span><span id="en32204">Wouldn't it?  </span><span id="en32206">Wouldn't it?  </span><span id="en32208">I notice that you've begun to be very attentive...  </span><span id="en32210">you interesting young man...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32215">Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently.  </span><span id="en32217">He was flushed.  </span><span id="en32219">Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him—and he resolved to take advantage of the opportunity.  </span><span id="en32221">He felt very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32224">"Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have come to Petersburg with designs on my sister," he said directly to Svidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32227">"Oh, nonsense," said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. " </span><span id="en32229">Why, I told you...  </span><span id="en32231">besides your sister can't endure me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32234">"Yes, I am certain that she can't, but that's not the point." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32237">"Are you so sure that she can't?"  </span><span id="en32239">Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and smiled mockingly. " </span><span id="en32241">You are right, she doesn't love me, but you can never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress.  </span><span id="en32243">There's always a little corner which remains a secret to the world and is only known to those two.  </span><span id="en32245">Will you answer for it that Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32248">"From some words you've dropped, I notice that you still have designs—and of course evil ones—on Dounia and mean to carry them out promptly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32251">"What, have I dropped words like that?"  </span><span id="en32253">Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve dismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his designs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32256">"Why, you are dropping them even now.  </span><span id="en32258">Why are you so frightened?  </span><span id="en32260">What are you so afraid of now?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32263">"Me—afraid?  </span><span id="en32265">Afraid of you?  </span><span id="en32266">You have rather to be afraid of me,  </span><i><span id="en32267">cher ami </span></i><span id="en32269">. But what nonsense....  </span><span id="en32271">I've drunk too much though, I see that.  </span><span id="en32273">I was almost saying too much again.  </span><span id="en32275">Damn the wine!  </span><span id="en32277">Hi!  </span><span id="en32279">there, water!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32283">He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window.  </span><span id="en32285">Philip brought the water. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32288">"That's all nonsense!"  </span><span id="en32290">said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it to his head. " </span><span id="en32292">But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions.  </span><span id="en32294">Do you know that I am going to get married?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32297">"You told me so before." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32300">"Did I?  </span><span id="en32302">I've forgotten.  </span><span id="en32304">But I couldn't have told you so for certain for I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to.  </span><span id="en32306">But now I really have a betrothed and it's a settled thing, and if it weren't that I have business that can't be put off, I would have taken you to see them at once, for I should like to ask your advice.  </span><span id="en32308">Ach, hang it, only ten minutes left!  </span><span id="en32310">See, look at the watch.  </span><span id="en32312">But I must tell you, for it's an interesting story, my marriage, in its own way.  </span><span id="en32314">Where are you off to?  </span><span id="en32316">Going again?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32319">"No, I'm not going away now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32322">"Not at all?  </span><span id="en32324">We shall see.  </span><span id="en32326">I'll take you there, I'll show you my betrothed, only not now.  </span><span id="en32328">For you'll soon have to be off.  </span><span id="en32330">You have to go to the right and I to the left.  </span><span id="en32332">Do you know that Madame Resslich, the woman I am lodging with now, eh?  </span><span id="en32334">I know what you're thinking, that she's the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter.  </span><span id="en32336">Come, are you listening?  </span><span id="en32338">She arranged it all for me.  </span><span id="en32340">You're bored, she said, you want something to fill up your time.  </span><span id="en32342">For, you know, I am a gloomy, depressed person.  </span><span id="en32344">Do you think I'm light-hearted?  </span><span id="en32346">No, I'm gloomy.  </span><span id="en32348">I do no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a time.  </span><span id="en32350">And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you.  </span><span id="en32352">I know what she has got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and depart, and she'll get hold of her and make a profit out of her—in our class, of course, or higher.  </span><span id="en32354">She told me the father was a broken-down retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three years with his legs paralysed.  </span><span id="en32356">The mamma, she said, was a sensible woman.  </span><span id="en32358">There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn't help; there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn't visit them.  </span><span id="en32360">And they've two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children were not enough, and they've taken from school their youngest daughter, a girl who'll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be married.  </span><span id="en32362">She was for me.  </span><span id="en32364">We went there.  </span><span id="en32366">How funny it was!  </span><span id="en32368">I present myself—a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections, with a fortune.  </span><span id="en32370">What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen?  </span><span id="en32372">Who thinks of that?  </span><span id="en32374">But it's fascinating, isn't it?  </span><span id="en32376">It is fascinating, ha-ha!  </span><span id="en32378">You should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma.  </span><span id="en32380">It was worth paying to have seen me at that moment.  </span><span id="en32382">She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy, still in a short frock—an unopened bud!  </span><span id="en32384">Flushing like a sunset—she had been told, no doubt.  </span><span id="en32386">I don't know how you feel about female faces, but to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little picture, too.  </span><span id="en32388">Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb's, full little rosy lips, tiny feet, a charmer!...  </span><span id="en32390">Well, we made friends.  </span><span id="en32392">I told them I was in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is the day before yesterday, we were betrothed.  </span><span id="en32394">When I go now I take her on my knee at once and keep her there....  </span><span id="en32396">Well, she flushes like a sunset and I kiss her every minute.  </span><span id="en32398">Her mamma of course impresses on her that this is her husband and that this must be so.  </span><span id="en32400">It's simply delicious!  </span><span id="en32402">The present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage.  </span><span id="en32403">Here you have what is called  </span><i><span id="en32404">la nature et la vérité </span></i><span id="en32406">, ha-ha!  </span><span id="en32408">I've talked to her twice, she is far from a fool.  </span><span id="en32410">Sometimes she steals a look at me that positively scorches me.  </span><span id="en32412">Her face is like Raphael's Madonna.  </span><span id="en32414">You know, the Sistine Madonna's face has something fantastic in it, the face of mournful religious ecstasy.  </span><span id="en32416">Haven't you noticed it?  </span><span id="en32418">Well, she's something in that line.  </span><span id="en32420">The day after we'd been betrothed, I bought her presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles—a set of diamonds and another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna's face glowed.  </span><span id="en32422">I sat her on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously—she flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn't want to show it.  </span><span id="en32423">We were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is my  </span><i><span id="en32424">respect </span></i><span id="en32426">, and that she wants 'nothing, nothing more from me, no presents. </span><span id="en32428">' You'll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is rather fascinating!  </span><span id="en32430">Isn't it fascinating?  </span><span id="en32432">It's worth paying for, isn't it?  </span><span id="en32434">Well...  </span><span id="en32436">listen, we'll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32441">"The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites your sensuality!  </span><span id="en32443">Will you really make such a marriage?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32446">"Why, of course.  </span><span id="en32448">Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself.  </span><span id="en32450">Ha-ha!  </span><span id="en32452">But why are you so keen about virtue?  </span><span id="en32454">Have mercy on me, my good friend.  </span><span id="en32456">I am a sinful man.  </span><span id="en32458">Ha-ha-ha!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32461">"But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna.  </span><span id="en32463">Though...  </span><span id="en32465">though you had your own reasons....  </span><span id="en32467">I understand it all now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32470">"I am always fond of children, very fond of them," laughed Svidrigaïlov. " </span><span id="en32472">I can tell you one curious instance of it.  </span><span id="en32474">The first day I came here I visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them.  </span><span id="en32476">You probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my old friends.  </span><span id="en32478">I shall do without them as long as I can.  </span><span id="en32480">Do you know, when I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great deal.  </span><span id="en32482">Yes, upon my soul!  </span><span id="en32484">The peasants have vodka, the educated young people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery.  </span><span id="en32486">From the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours.  </span><span id="en32487">I chanced to be in a frightful den—I like my dens dirty—it was a dance, so called, and there was a  </span><i><span id="en32488">cancan </span></i><span id="en32489">  </span><span id="en32490">such as I never saw in my day.  </span><span id="en32492">Yes, there you have progress.  </span><span id="en32493">All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one  </span><i><span id="en32494">vis-à-vis </span></i><span id="en32496">. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall.  </span><span id="en32497">You can't fancy what a  </span><i><span id="en32498">cancan </span></i><span id="en32499">  </span><span id="en32500">that was!  </span><span id="en32502">The girl was ashamed, blushed, at last felt insulted, and began to cry.  </span><span id="en32503">Her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and—I like your public, even the  </span><i><span id="en32504">cancan </span></i><span id="en32505">  </span><span id="en32506">public—they laughed and shouted, 'Serves her right—serves her right!  </span><span id="en32508">Shouldn't bring children! </span><span id="en32510">' Well, it's not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or not.  </span><span id="en32512">I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and that they couldn't distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect, gave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them home in my carriage.  </span><span id="en32514">I took them home and got to know them.  </span><span id="en32516">They were lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country.  </span><span id="en32518">She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an honour.  </span><span id="en32520">I found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business.  </span><span id="en32522">I proffered my services and money.  </span><span id="en32524">I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class.  </span><span id="en32526">I offered to assist in the young girl's education in French and dancing.  </span><span id="en32528">My offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an honour—and we are still friendly....  </span><span id="en32530">If you like, we'll go and see them, only not just now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32537">"Stop!  </span><span id="en32539">Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual man!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32542">"Schiller, you are a regular Schiller!  </span><i><span id="en32545">O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher? </span></i><span id="en32547">  </span><span id="en32548">But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure of hearing your outcries!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32554">"I dare say.  </span><span id="en32556">I can see I am ridiculous myself," muttered Raskolnikov angrily. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32559">Svidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill, and began getting up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32561">"I say, but I am drunk,  </span><i><span id="en32562">assez causé </span></i><span id="en32564">," he said. " </span><span id="en32566">It's been a pleasure." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32570">"I should rather think it must be a pleasure!"  </span><span id="en32572">cried Raskolnikov, getting up. " </span><span id="en32574">No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in his mind—especially under such circumstances and to such a man as me....  </span><span id="en32576">It's stimulating!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32579">"Well, if you come to that," Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising Raskolnikov with some surprise, "if you come to that, you are a thorough cynic yourself.  </span><span id="en32581">You've plenty to make you so, anyway.  </span><span id="en32583">You can understand a great deal...  </span><span id="en32585">and you can do a great deal too.  </span><span id="en32587">But enough.  </span><span id="en32589">I sincerely regret not having had more talk with you, but I shan't lose sight of you....  </span><span id="en32591">Only wait a bit." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32594">Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant.  </span><span id="en32596">Raskolnikov walked out after him.  </span><span id="en32598">Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him for a moment, but it was passing off every minute.  </span><span id="en32600">He was preoccupied with something of importance and was frowning.  </span><span id="en32602">He was apparently excited and uneasy in anticipation of something.  </span><span id="en32604">His manner to Raskolnikov had changed during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering every moment.  </span><span id="en32606">Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy.  </span><span id="en32608">He became very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32611">They came out on to the pavement. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32614">"You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.  </span><span id="en32615">Only  </span><i><span id="en32616">adieu, mon plaisir </span></i><span id="en32618">, may we meet again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32622">And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market. </span></p>

<p><span id="en32626">Raskolnikov walked after him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32629">"What's this?"  </span><span id="en32631">cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, "I thought I said..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32634">"It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32637">"What?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32640">Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their strength. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32642">"From all your half tipsy stories," Raskolnikov observed harshly, "I am  </span><i><span id="en32643">positive </span></i><span id="en32644">  </span><span id="en32645">that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but are pursuing them more actively than ever.  </span><span id="en32647">I have learnt that my sister received a letter this morning.  </span><span id="en32649">You have hardly been able to sit still all this time....  </span><span id="en32651">You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that means nothing.  </span><span id="en32653">I should like to make certain myself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32657">Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he wished to make certain. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32660">"Upon my word!  </span><span id="en32662">I'll call the police!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32665">"Call away!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32668">Again they stood for a minute facing each other.  </span><span id="en32670">At last Svidrigaïlov's face changed.  </span><span id="en32672">Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not frightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32675">"What a fellow!  </span><span id="en32677">I purposely refrained from referring to your affair, though I am devoured by curiosity.  </span><span id="en32679">It's a fantastic affair.  </span><span id="en32681">I've put it off till another time, but you're enough to rouse the dead....  </span><span id="en32683">Well, let us go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment, to get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to spend the evening at the Islands.  </span><span id="en32685">Now, now are you going to follow me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32688">"I'm coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to say I'm sorry not to have been at the funeral." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32691">"That's as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home.  </span><span id="en32693">She has taken the three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some orphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago.  </span><span id="en32695">I charmed the old lady by depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well.  </span><span id="en32697">I told her too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.  </span><span id="en32699">It produced an indescribable effect on her.  </span><span id="en32701">That's why Sofya Semyonovna has been invited to call to-day at the X.  </span><span id="en32703">Hotel where the lady is staying for the time." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32706">"No matter, I'll come all the same." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32709">"As you like, it's nothing to me, but I won't come with you; here we are at home.  </span><span id="en32711">By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with questions...  </span><span id="en32713">you understand?  </span><span id="en32715">It struck you as extraordinary; I don't mind betting it's that.  </span><span id="en32717">Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32720">"And to listen at doors!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32723">"Ah, that's it, is it?"  </span><span id="en32725">laughed Svidrigaïlov. " </span><span id="en32727">Yes, I should have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened.  </span><span id="en32729">Ha-ha!  </span><span id="en32731">Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and were telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it?  </span><span id="en32733">Perhaps I am quite behind the times and can't understand.  </span><span id="en32735">For goodness' sake, explain it, my dear boy.  </span><span id="en32737">Expound the latest theories!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32740">"You couldn't have heard anything.  </span><span id="en32742">You're making it all up!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32745">"But I'm not talking about that (though I did hear something).  </span><span id="en32747">No, I'm talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now.  </span><span id="en32749">The Schiller in you is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at doors.  </span><span id="en32751">If that's how you feel, go and inform the police that you had this mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory.  </span><span id="en32753">But if you are convinced that one mustn't listen at doors, but one may murder old women at one's pleasure, you'd better be off to America and make haste.  </span><span id="en32755">Run, young man!  </span><span id="en32757">There may still be time.  </span><span id="en32759">I'm speaking sincerely.  </span><span id="en32761">Haven't you the money?  </span><span id="en32763">I'll give you the fare." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32766">"I'm not thinking of that at all," Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32769">"I understand (but don't put yourself out, don't discuss it if you don't want to).  </span><span id="en32771">I understand the questions you are worrying over—moral ones, aren't they?  </span><span id="en32773">Duties of citizen and man?  </span><span id="en32775">Lay them all aside.  </span><span id="en32777">They are nothing to you now, ha-ha!  </span><span id="en32779">You'll say you are still a man and a citizen.  </span><span id="en32781">If so you ought not to have got into this coil.  </span><span id="en32783">It's no use taking up a job you are not fit for.  </span><span id="en32785">Well, you'd better shoot yourself, or don't you want to?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32788">"You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32791">"What a queer fellow!  </span><span id="en32793">But here we are.  </span><span id="en32795">Welcome to the staircase.  </span><span id="en32797">You see, that's the way to Sofya Semyonovna.  </span><span id="en32799">Look, there is no one at home.  </span><span id="en32801">Don't you believe me?  </span><span id="en32803">Ask Kapernaumov.  </span><span id="en32805">She leaves the key with him.  </span><span id="en32807">Here is Madame de Kapernaumov herself.  </span><span id="en32809">Hey, what?  </span><span id="en32811">She is rather deaf.  </span><span id="en32813">Has she gone out?  </span><span id="en32815">Where?  </span><span id="en32817">Did you hear?  </span><span id="en32819">She is not in and won't be till late in the evening probably.  </span><span id="en32821">Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see me, didn't you?  </span><span id="en32823">Here we are.  </span><span id="en32825">Madame Resslich's not at home.  </span><span id="en32827">She is a woman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you....  </span><span id="en32829">She might have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible.  </span><span id="en32831">Now, see!  </span><span id="en32833">I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau—see what a lot I've got of them still—this one will be turned into cash to-day.  </span><span id="en32835">I mustn't waste any more time.  </span><span id="en32837">The bureau is locked, the flat is locked, and here we are again on the stairs.  </span><span id="en32839">Shall we take a cab?  </span><span id="en32841">I'm going to the Islands.  </span><span id="en32843">Would you like a lift?  </span><span id="en32845">I'll take this carriage.  </span><span id="en32847">Ah, you refuse?  </span><span id="en32849">You are tired of it!  </span><span id="en32851">Come for a drive!  </span><span id="en32853">I believe it will come on to rain.  </span><span id="en32855">Never mind, we'll put down the hood...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32858">Svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage.  </span><span id="en32860">Raskolnikov decided that his suspicions were at least for that moment unjust.  </span><span id="en32862">Without answering a word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market.  </span><span id="en32864">If he had only turned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement.  </span><span id="en32866">But he had turned the corner and could see nothing.  </span><span id="en32868">Intense disgust drew him away from Svidrigaïlov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32871">"To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!"  </span><span id="en32873">he cried. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32876">Raskolnikov's judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a mysterious character.  </span><span id="en32878">As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace.  </span><span id="en32880">But it was too tiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32883">When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as usual, into deep thought.  </span><span id="en32885">On the bridge he stood by the railing and began gazing at the water.  </span><span id="en32887">And his sister was standing close by him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32890">He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing her.  </span><span id="en32892">Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was struck with dismay.  </span><span id="en32894">She stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not.  </span><span id="en32896">Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of the Hay Market. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32899">He seemed to be approaching cautiously.  </span><span id="en32901">He did not go on to the bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid Raskolnikov's seeing him.  </span><span id="en32903">He had observed Dounia for some time and had been making signs to her.  </span><span id="en32905">She fancied he was signalling to beg her not to speak to her brother, but to come to him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32908">That was what Dounia did.  </span><span id="en32910">She stole by her brother and went up to Svidrigaïlov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32913">"Let us make haste away," Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, "I don't want Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting.  </span><span id="en32915">I must tell you I've been sitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and I had great difficulty in getting rid of him.  </span><span id="en32917">He has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something.  </span><span id="en32919">It wasn't you who told him, of course, but if not you, who then?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32922">"Well, we've turned the corner now," Dounia interrupted, "and my brother won't see us.  </span><span id="en32924">I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.  </span><span id="en32926">Speak to me here.  </span><span id="en32928">You can tell it all in the street." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32931">"In the first place, I can't say it in the street; secondly, you must hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....  </span><span id="en32933">Oh well, if you won't agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at once.  </span><span id="en32935">But I beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of your beloved brother's is entirely in my keeping." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32938">Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with searching eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32941">"What are you afraid of?"  </span><span id="en32943">he observed quietly. " </span><span id="en32945">The town is not the country.  </span><span id="en32947">And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en32950">"Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32953">"No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she is at home now.  </span><span id="en32955">But most likely she is.  </span><span id="en32957">She has buried her stepmother to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day.  </span><span id="en32959">For the time I don't want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken to you.  </span><span id="en32961">The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like this.  </span><span id="en32963">I live there in that house, we are coming to it.  </span><span id="en32965">That's the porter of our house—he knows me very well; you see, he's bowing; he sees I'm coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious.  </span><span id="en32967">Excuse my putting things so coarsely.  </span><span id="en32969">I haven't a flat to myself; Sofya Semyonovna's room is next to mine—she lodges in the next flat.  </span><span id="en32971">The whole floor is let out in lodgings.  </span><span id="en32973">Why are you frightened like a child?  </span><span id="en32975">Am I really so terrible?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en32978">Svidrigaïlov's lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in no smiling mood.  </span><span id="en32980">His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.  </span><span id="en32982">He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement.  </span><span id="en32984">But Dounia did not notice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32987">"Though I know that you are not a man...  </span><span id="en32989">of honour, I am not in the least afraid of you.  </span><span id="en32991">Lead the way," she said with apparent composure, but her face was very pale. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32994">Svidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia's room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en32997">"Allow me to inquire whether she is at home....  </span><span id="en32999">She is not.  </span><span id="en33001">How unfortunate!  </span><span id="en33003">But I know she may come quite soon.  </span><span id="en33005">If she's gone out, it can only be to see a lady about the orphans.  </span><span id="en33007">Their mother is dead....  </span><span id="en33009">I've been meddling and making arrangements for them.  </span><span id="en33011">If Sofya Semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if you like.  </span><span id="en33013">This is my flat.  </span><span id="en33015">These are my two rooms.  </span><span id="en33017">Madame Resslich, my landlady, has the next room.  </span><span id="en33019">Now, look this way.  </span><span id="en33021">I will show you my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms, which are to let.  </span><span id="en33023">Here they are...  </span><span id="en33025">You must look into them with some attention." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33028">Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms.  </span><span id="en33030">Dounia was looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the rooms.  </span><span id="en33032">Yet there was something to observe, for instance, that Svidrigaïlov's flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited apartments.  </span><span id="en33034">His rooms were not entered directly from the passage, but through the landlady's two almost empty rooms.  </span><span id="en33036">Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia the two empty rooms that were to let.  </span><span id="en33038">Dounia stopped in the doorway, not knowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to explain. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33041">"Look here, at this second large room.  </span><span id="en33043">Notice that door, it's locked.  </span><span id="en33045">By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms.  </span><span id="en33047">I brought it from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently.  </span><span id="en33049">Just the other side of the door is Sofya Semyonovna's table; she sat there talking to Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en33051">And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for two hours each time—and of course I was able to learn something, what do you think?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33054">"You listened?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33057">"Yes, I did.  </span><span id="en33059">Now come back to my room; we can't sit down here." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33062">He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her a chair.  </span><span id="en33064">He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven feet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which had once frightened Dounia so much.  </span><span id="en33066">She shuddered and once more looked about her distrustfully.  </span><span id="en33068">It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness.  </span><span id="en33070">But the secluded position of Svidrigaïlov's lodging had suddenly struck her.  </span><span id="en33072">She wanted to ask whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from asking.  </span><span id="en33074">Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than fear for herself.  </span><span id="en33076">She was in great distress. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33079">"Here is your letter," she said, laying it on the table. " </span><span id="en33081">Can it be true what you write?  </span><span id="en33083">You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.  </span><span id="en33085">You hint at it too clearly; you daren't deny it now.  </span><span id="en33087">I must tell you that I'd heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don't believe a word of it.  </span><span id="en33089">It's a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion.  </span><span id="en33091">I know the story and why and how it was invented.  </span><span id="en33093">You can have no proofs.  </span><span id="en33095">You promised to prove it.  </span><span id="en33097">Speak!  </span><span id="en33099">But let me warn you that I don't believe you!  </span><span id="en33101">I don't believe you!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33104">Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour rushed to her face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33107">"If you didn't believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?  </span><span id="en33109">Why have you come?  </span><span id="en33111">Simply from curiosity?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33114">"Don't torment me.  </span><span id="en33116">Speak, speak!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33119">"There's no denying that you are a brave girl.  </span><span id="en33121">Upon my word, I thought you would have asked Mr.  </span><span id="en33123">Razumihin to escort you here.  </span><span id="en33125">But he was not with you nor anywhere near.  </span><span id="en33127">I was on the look-out.  </span><span id="en33129">It's spirited of you, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en33131">But everything is divine in you....  </span><span id="en33133">About your brother, what am I to say to you?  </span><span id="en33135">You've just seen him yourself.  </span><span id="en33137">What did you think of him?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33140">"Surely that's not the only thing you are building on?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33143">"No, not on that, but on his own words.  </span><span id="en33145">He came here on two successive evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna.  </span><span id="en33147">I've shown you where they sat.  </span><span id="en33149">He made a full confession to her.  </span><span id="en33151">He is a murderer.  </span><span id="en33153">He killed an old woman, a pawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself.  </span><span id="en33155">He killed her sister too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he was murdering her sister.  </span><span id="en33157">He killed them with an axe he brought with him.  </span><span id="en33159">He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them.  </span><span id="en33161">He took money and various things....  </span><span id="en33163">He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna, the only person who knows his secret.  </span><span id="en33165">But she has had no share by word or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now.  </span><span id="en33167">Don't be anxious, she won't betray him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33170">"It cannot be," muttered Dounia, with white lips.  </span><span id="en33172">She gasped for breath. " </span><span id="en33174">It cannot be.  </span><span id="en33176">There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....  </span><span id="en33178">It's a lie, a lie!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33181">"He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things.  </span><span id="en33183">It's true that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid them under a stone, where they are now.  </span><span id="en33185">But that was because he dared not make use of them." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33188">"But how could he steal, rob?  </span><span id="en33190">How could he dream of it?"  </span><span id="en33192">cried Dounia, and she jumped up from the chair. " </span><span id="en33194">Why, you know him, and you've seen him, can he be a thief?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33197">She seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten her fear. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33200">"There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities, Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en33202">A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I've heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail.  </span><span id="en33204">Who knows, very likely he thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing!  </span><span id="en33206">Of course I should not have believed it myself if I'd been told of it as you have, but I believe my own ears.  </span><span id="en33208">He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but she did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at last." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33211">"What...  </span><span id="en33213">were the causes?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33216">"It's a long story, Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en33218">Here's...  </span><span id="en33220">how shall I tell you? </span><span id="en33222">—A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds!  </span><span id="en33224">It's galling too, of course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand.  </span><span id="en33226">Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social position and his sister's and mother's position too.  </span><span id="en33228">Above all, vanity, pride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities too....  </span><span id="en33230">I am not blaming him, please don't think it; besides, it's not my business.  </span><span id="en33232">A special little theory came in too—a theory of a sort—dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons, that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that is.  </span><span id="en33233">It's all right as a theory,  </span><i><span id="en33234">une théorie comme une autre </span></i><span id="en33236">. Napoleon attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have overstepped the law without thinking about it.  </span><span id="en33238">He seems to have fancied that he was a genius too—that is, he was convinced of it for a time.  </span><span id="en33240">He has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law, and so he is not a man of genius.  </span><span id="en33242">And that's humiliating for a young man of any pride, in our day especially...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33246">"But remorse?  </span><span id="en33248">You deny him any moral feeling then?  </span><span id="en33250">Is he like that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33253">"Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was ever in very good order.  </span><span id="en33255">Russians in general are broad in their ideas, Avdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic, the chaotic.  </span><span id="en33257">But it's a misfortune to be broad without a special genius.  </span><span id="en33259">Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper?  </span><span id="en33261">Why, you used to reproach me with breadth!  </span><span id="en33263">Who knows, perhaps we were talking at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan.  </span><span id="en33265">There are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class, Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en33267">At the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old chronicle.  </span><span id="en33269">But those are for the most part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost ill-bred in a man of society.  </span><span id="en33271">You know my opinions in general, though.  </span><span id="en33273">I never blame anyone.  </span><span id="en33275">I do nothing at all, I persevere in that.  </span><span id="en33277">But we've talked of this more than once before.  </span><span id="en33279">I was so happy indeed as to interest you in my opinions....  </span><span id="en33281">You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33284">"I know his theory.  </span><span id="en33286">I read that article of his about men to whom all is permitted.  </span><span id="en33288">Razumihin brought it to me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33291">"Mr.  </span><span id="en33293">Razumihin?  </span><span id="en33295">Your brother's article?  </span><span id="en33297">In a magazine?  </span><span id="en33299">Is there such an article?  </span><span id="en33301">I didn't know.  </span><span id="en33303">It must be interesting.  </span><span id="en33305">But where are you going, Avdotya Romanovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33308">"I want to see Sofya Semyonovna," Dounia articulated faintly. " </span><span id="en33310">How do I go to her?  </span><span id="en33312">She has come in, perhaps.  </span><span id="en33314">I must see her at once.  </span><span id="en33316">Perhaps she..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33319">Avdotya Romanovna could not finish.  </span><span id="en33321">Her breath literally failed her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33324">"Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.  </span><span id="en33326">She was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in till quite late." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33329">"Ah, then you are lying!  </span><span id="en33331">I see...  </span><span id="en33333">you were lying...  </span><span id="en33335">lying all the time....  </span><span id="en33337">I don't believe you!  </span><span id="en33339">I don't believe you!"  </span><span id="en33341">cried Dounia, completely losing her head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33344">Almost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to give her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33347">"Avdotya Romanovna, what is it?  </span><span id="en33349">Control yourself!  </span><span id="en33351">Here is some water.  </span><span id="en33353">Drink a little...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33356">He sprinkled some water over her.  </span><span id="en33358">Dounia shuddered and came to herself. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33361">"It has acted violently," Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning. " </span><span id="en33363">Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself!  </span><span id="en33365">Believe me, he has friends.  </span><span id="en33367">We will save him.  </span><span id="en33369">Would you like me to take him abroad?  </span><span id="en33371">I have money, I can get a ticket in three days.  </span><span id="en33373">And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of good deeds yet, to atone for it.  </span><span id="en33375">Calm yourself.  </span><span id="en33377">He may become a great man yet.  </span><span id="en33379">Well, how are you?  </span><span id="en33381">How do you feel?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33384">"Cruel man!  </span><span id="en33386">To be able to jeer at it!  </span><span id="en33388">Let me go..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33391">"Where are you going?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33394">"To him.  </span><span id="en33396">Where is he?  </span><span id="en33398">Do you know?  </span><span id="en33400">Why is this door locked?  </span><span id="en33402">We came in at that door and now it is locked.  </span><span id="en33404">When did you manage to lock it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33407">"We couldn't be shouting all over the flat on such a subject.  </span><span id="en33409">I am far from jeering; it's simply that I'm sick of talking like this.  </span><span id="en33411">But how can you go in such a state?  </span><span id="en33413">Do you want to betray him?  </span><span id="en33415">You will drive him to fury, and he will give himself up.  </span><span id="en33417">Let me tell you, he is already being watched; they are already on his track.  </span><span id="en33419">You will simply be giving him away.  </span><span id="en33421">Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now.  </span><span id="en33423">He can still be saved.  </span><span id="en33425">Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.  </span><span id="en33427">I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly.  </span><span id="en33429">But do sit down!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33432">"How can you save him?  </span><span id="en33434">Can he really be saved?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33437">Dounia sat down.  </span><span id="en33439">Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33442">"It all depends on you, on you, on you alone," he began with glowing eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for emotion. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33445">Dounia drew back from him in alarm.  </span><span id="en33447">He too was trembling all over. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33450">"You...  </span><span id="en33452">one word from you, and he is saved.  </span><span id="en33454">I...  </span><span id="en33456">I'll save him.  </span><span id="en33458">I have money and friends.  </span><span id="en33460">I'll send him away at once.  </span><span id="en33462">I'll get a passport, two passports, one for him and one for me.  </span><span id="en33464">I have friends...  </span><span id="en33466">capable people....  </span><span id="en33468">If you like, I'll take a passport for you...  </span><span id="en33470">for your mother....  </span><span id="en33472">What do you want with Razumihin?  </span><span id="en33474">I love you too....  </span><span id="en33476">I love you beyond everything....  </span><span id="en33478">Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let me....  </span><span id="en33480">The very rustle of it is too much for me.  </span><span id="en33482">Tell me, 'do that,' and I'll do it.  </span><span id="en33484">I'll do everything.  </span><span id="en33486">I will do the impossible.  </span><span id="en33488">What you believe, I will believe.  </span><span id="en33490">I'll do anything—anything!  </span><span id="en33492">Don't, don't look at me like that.  </span><span id="en33494">Do you know that you are killing me?..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33497">He was almost beginning to rave....  </span><span id="en33499">Something seemed suddenly to go to his head.  </span><span id="en33501">Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33504">"Open it!  </span><span id="en33506">Open it!"  </span><span id="en33508">she called, shaking the door. " </span><span id="en33510">Open it!  </span><span id="en33512">Is there no one there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33515">Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself.  </span><span id="en33517">His still trembling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33520">"There is no one at home," he said quietly and emphatically. " </span><span id="en33522">The landlady has gone out, and it's waste of time to shout like that.  </span><span id="en33524">You are only exciting yourself uselessly." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33527">"Where is the key?  </span><span id="en33529">Open the door at once, at once, base man!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33532">"I have lost the key and cannot find it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33535">"This is an outrage," cried Dounia, turning pale as death.  </span><span id="en33537">She rushed to the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33540">She did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched every movement he made. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33543">Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.  </span><span id="en33545">He was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was pale as before.  </span><span id="en33547">The mocking smile did not leave his face. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33550">"You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en33552">In that case you may be sure I've taken measures.  </span><span id="en33554">Sofya Semyonovna is not at home.  </span><span id="en33556">The Kapernaumovs are far away—there are five locked rooms between.  </span><span id="en33558">I am at least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.  </span><span id="en33560">For you could not complain afterwards.  </span><span id="en33562">You surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother?  </span><span id="en33564">Besides, no one would believe you.  </span><span id="en33566">How should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?  </span><span id="en33568">So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.  </span><span id="en33570">It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33573">"Scoundrel!"  </span><span id="en33575">whispered Dounia indignantly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33578">"As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general proposition.  </span><span id="en33580">It's my personal conviction that you are perfectly right—violence is hateful.  </span><span id="en33582">I only spoke to show you that you need have no remorse even if...  </span><span id="en33584">you were willing to save your brother of your own accord, as I suggest to you.  </span><span id="en33586">You would be simply submitting to circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word.  </span><span id="en33588">Think about it.  </span><span id="en33590">Your brother's and your mother's fate are in your hands.  </span><span id="en33592">I will be your slave...  </span><span id="en33594">all my life...  </span><span id="en33596">I will wait here." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33599">Svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia.  </span><span id="en33601">She had not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination.  </span><span id="en33603">Besides, she knew him.  </span><span id="en33605">Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it and laid it in her hand on the table.  </span><span id="en33607">Svidrigaïlov jumped up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33610">"Aha!  </span><span id="en33612">So that's it, is it?"  </span><span id="en33614">he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously. " </span><span id="en33616">Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs.  </span><span id="en33618">You've made things wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna.  </span><span id="en33620">But where did you get the revolver?  </span><span id="en33622">Was it Mr.  </span><span id="en33624">Razumihin?  </span><span id="en33626">Why, it's my revolver, an old friend!  </span><span id="en33628">And how I've hunted for it!  </span><span id="en33630">The shooting lessons I've given you in the country have not been thrown away." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33633">"It's not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed, wretch!  </span><span id="en33635">There was nothing of yours in her house.  </span><span id="en33637">I took it when I began to suspect what you were capable of.  </span><span id="en33639">If you dare to advance one step, I swear I'll kill you."  </span><span id="en33641">She was frantic. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33644">"But your brother?  </span><span id="en33646">I ask from curiosity," said Svidrigaïlov, still standing where he was. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33649">"Inform, if you want to!  </span><span id="en33651">Don't stir!  </span><span id="en33653">Don't come nearer!  </span><span id="en33655">I'll shoot!  </span><span id="en33657">You poisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!"  </span><span id="en33659">She held the revolver ready. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33662">"Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33665">"You did!  </span><span id="en33667">You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison....  </span><span id="en33669">I know you went to get it...  </span><span id="en33671">you had it in readiness....  </span><span id="en33673">It was your doing....  </span><span id="en33675">It must have been your doing....  </span><span id="en33677">Scoundrel!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33680">"Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake...  </span><span id="en33682">you would have been the cause." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33685">"You are lying!  </span><span id="en33687">I hated you always, always...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33690">"Oho, Avdotya Romanovna!  </span><span id="en33692">You seem to have forgotten how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda.  </span><span id="en33694">I saw it in your eyes.  </span><span id="en33696">Do you remember that moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33699">"That's a lie," there was a flash of fury in Dounia's eyes, "that's a lie and a libel!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33702">"A lie?  </span><span id="en33704">Well, if you like, it's a lie.  </span><span id="en33706">I made it up.  </span><span id="en33708">Women ought not to be reminded of such things," he smiled. " </span><span id="en33710">I know you will shoot, you pretty wild creature.  </span><span id="en33712">Well, shoot away!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33715">Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his part.  </span><span id="en33717">Her lower lip was white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire.  </span><span id="en33719">He had never seen her so handsome.  </span><span id="en33721">The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of anguish in his heart.  </span><span id="en33723">He took a step forward and a shot rang out.  </span><span id="en33725">The bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind.  </span><span id="en33727">He stood still and laughed softly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33730">"The wasp has stung me.  </span><span id="en33732">She aimed straight at my head.  </span><span id="en33734">What's this?  </span><span id="en33736">Blood?"  </span><span id="en33738">he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed in a thin stream down his right temple.  </span><span id="en33740">The bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33743">Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement.  </span><span id="en33745">She seemed not to understand what she was doing and what was going on. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33748">"Well, you missed!  </span><span id="en33750">Fire again, I'll wait," said Svidrigaïlov softly, still smiling, but gloomily. " </span><span id="en33752">If you go on like that, I shall have time to seize you before you cock again." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33755">Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33758">"Let me be," she cried in despair. " </span><span id="en33760">I swear I'll shoot again.  </span><span id="en33762">I...  </span><span id="en33764">I'll kill you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33767">"Well...  </span><span id="en33769">at three paces you can hardly help it.  </span><span id="en33771">But if you don't...  </span><span id="en33773">then."  </span><span id="en33775">His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward.  </span><span id="en33777">Dounia shot again: it missed fire. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33780">"You haven't loaded it properly.  </span><span id="en33782">Never mind, you have another charge there.  </span><span id="en33784">Get it ready, I'll wait." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33787">He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes.  </span><span id="en33789">Dounia saw that he would sooner die than let her go. " </span><span id="en33791">And...  </span><span id="en33793">now, of course she would kill him, at two paces!"  </span><span id="en33795">Suddenly she flung away the revolver. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33798">"She's dropped it!"  </span><span id="en33800">said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep breath.  </span><span id="en33802">A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart—perhaps not only the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.  </span><span id="en33804">It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter, which he could not himself have defined. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33807">He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist.  </span><span id="en33809">She did not resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.  </span><span id="en33811">He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to utter a sound. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33814">"Let me go," Dounia implored.  </span><span id="en33816">Svidrigaïlov shuddered.  </span><span id="en33818">Her voice now was quite different. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33821">"Then you don't love me?"  </span><span id="en33823">he asked softly.  </span><span id="en33825">Dounia shook her head. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33828">"And...  </span><span id="en33830">and you can't?  </span><span id="en33832">Never?"  </span><span id="en33834">he whispered in despair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33837">"Never!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33840">There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en33842">He looked at her with an indescribable gaze.  </span><span id="en33844">Suddenly he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.  </span><span id="en33846">Another moment passed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33849">"Here's the key." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33852">He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33855">"Take it!  </span><span id="en33857">Make haste!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en33860">He looked stubbornly out of the window.  </span><span id="en33862">Dounia went up to the table to take the key. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33865">"Make haste!  </span><span id="en33867">Make haste!"  </span><span id="en33869">repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning or moving.  </span><span id="en33871">But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that "make haste." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33874">Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room.  </span><span id="en33876">A minute later, beside herself, she ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X.  </span><span id="en33878">Bridge. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33881">Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window.  </span><span id="en33883">At last he slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead.  </span><span id="en33885">A strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair.  </span><span id="en33887">The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.  </span><span id="en33889">He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.  </span><span id="en33891">The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly caught his eye.  </span><span id="en33893">He picked it up and examined it.  </span><span id="en33895">It was a little pocket three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction.  </span><span id="en33897">There were still two charges and one capsule left in it.  </span><span id="en33899">It could be fired again.  </span><span id="en33901">He thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went out. </span></p>

<p><span id="en33905">He spent that evening till ten o'clock going from one low haunt to another.  </span><span id="en33906">Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain </span></p>
<p><span id="en33907">"villain and tyrant," </span></p>
<p><span id="en33909">"began kissing Katia." </span></p>
<p><span id="en33912">Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks.  </span><span id="en33914">He was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the right.  </span><span id="en33916">They took him finally to a pleasure garden, where he paid for their entrance.  </span><span id="en33918">There was one lanky three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a "Vauxhall," which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.  </span><span id="en33920">A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public.  </span><span id="en33922">The clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.  </span><span id="en33924">Svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute.  </span><span id="en33926">He listened to them for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them.  </span><span id="en33928">The only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his companion.  </span><span id="en33930">Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging to the Vauxhall.  </span><span id="en33932">It was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome.  </span><span id="en33934">Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of the garden.  </span><span id="en33936">It was about six o'clock.  </span><span id="en33938">He had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33941">It was a dark and stifling evening.  </span><span id="en33943">Threatening storm-clouds came over the sky about ten o'clock.  </span><span id="en33945">There was a clap of thunder, and the rain came down like a waterfall.  </span><span id="en33947">The water fell not in drops, but beat on the earth in streams.  </span><span id="en33949">There were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33952">Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers.  </span><span id="en33954">Then, putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes, but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room without locking the door.  </span><span id="en33956">He went straight to Sonia.  </span><span id="en33958">She was at home. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33961">She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her.  </span><span id="en33963">She was giving them tea.  </span><span id="en33965">She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence, looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes.  </span><span id="en33967">The children all ran away at once in indescribable terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33970">Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.  </span><span id="en33972">She timidly prepared to listen. </span></p>
<p><span id="en33975">"I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna," said Svidrigaïlov, "and as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some arrangements.  </span><span id="en33977">Well, did you see the lady to-day?  </span><span id="en33979">I know what she said to you, you need not tell me."  </span><span id="en33981">(Sonia made a movement and blushed. </span><span id="en33983">) "Those people have their own way of doing things.  </span><span id="en33985">As to your sisters and your brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them I've put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments.  </span><span id="en33987">You had better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens.  </span><span id="en33989">Here, take them!  </span><span id="en33991">Well now, that's settled.  </span><span id="en33993">Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the value of three thousand roubles.  </span><span id="en33995">Take those for yourself, entirely for yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one knows of it, whatever you hear.  </span><span id="en33997">You will need the money, for to go on living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no need for it now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34000">"I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my stepmother," said Sonia hurriedly, "and if I've said so little...  </span><span id="en34002">please don't consider..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34005">"That's enough!  </span><span id="en34007">that's enough!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34010">"But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you, but I don't need it now.  </span><span id="en34012">I can always earn my own living.  </span><span id="en34014">Don't think me ungrateful.  </span><span id="en34016">If you are so charitable, that money...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34019">"It's for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don't waste words over it.  </span><span id="en34021">I haven't time for it.  </span><span id="en34023">You will want it.  </span><span id="en34025">Rodion Romanovitch has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia."  </span><span id="en34027">(Sonia looked wildly at him, and started. </span><span id="en34029">) "Don't be uneasy, I know all about it from himself and I am not a gossip; I won't tell anyone.  </span><span id="en34031">It was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess.  </span><span id="en34033">It would be much better for him.  </span><span id="en34035">Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and you will follow him.  </span><span id="en34037">That's so, isn't it?  </span><span id="en34039">And if so, you'll need money.  </span><span id="en34041">You'll need it for him, do you understand?  </span><span id="en34043">Giving it to you is the same as my giving it to him.  </span><span id="en34045">Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what's owing.  </span><span id="en34047">I heard you.  </span><span id="en34049">How can you undertake such obligations so heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna?  </span><span id="en34051">It was Katerina Ivanovna's debt and not yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.  </span><span id="en34053">You can't get through the world like that.  </span><span id="en34055">If you are ever questioned about me—to-morrow or the day after you will be asked—don't say anything about my coming to see you now and don't show the money to anyone or say a word about it.  </span><span id="en34057">Well, now good-bye."  </span><span id="en34059">(He got up. </span><span id="en34061">) "My greetings to Rodion Romanovitch.  </span><span id="en34063">By the way, you'd better put the money for the present in Mr.  </span><span id="en34065">Razumihin's keeping.  </span><span id="en34067">You know Mr.  </span><span id="en34069">Razumihin?  </span><span id="en34071">Of course you do.  </span><span id="en34073">He's not a bad fellow.  </span><span id="en34075">Take it to him to-morrow or...  </span><span id="en34077">when the time comes.  </span><span id="en34079">And till then, hide it carefully." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34082">Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en34084">She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she did not dare and did not know how to begin. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34087">"How can you...  </span><span id="en34089">how can you be going now, in such rain?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34092">"Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain!  </span><span id="en34094">Ha, ha!  </span><span id="en34096">Good-bye, Sofya Semyonovna, my dear!  </span><span id="en34098">Live and live long, you will be of use to others.  </span><span id="en34100">By the way...  </span><span id="en34102">tell Mr.  </span><span id="en34104">Razumihin I send my greetings to him.  </span><span id="en34106">Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings.  </span><span id="en34108">Be sure to." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34111">He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34114">It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven, he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit.  </span><span id="en34116">The rain still persisted.  </span><span id="en34118">Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky Island.  </span><span id="en34120">He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing vanished immediately.  </span><span id="en34122">The decrepit father was wheeled in to see Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions.  </span><span id="en34124">She never asked a direct question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she were obliged to ascertain something—for instance, when Svidrigaïlov would like to have the wedding—she would begin by interested and almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street.  </span><span id="en34126">On other occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she had already gone to bed.  </span><span id="en34128">The girl of course appeared. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34131">Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding.  </span><span id="en34133">The logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear.  </span><span id="en34135">But it all went off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret, the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained.  </span><span id="en34137">On the other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced by tears from the most sensible of mothers.  </span><span id="en34139">Svidrigaïlov got up, laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers.  </span><span id="en34141">He went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great wealth—there was no knowing what he had in his mind.  </span><span id="en34143">He would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that there was nothing surprising about it.  </span><span id="en34145">Of course it was strange that he was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric, and all these people of high society didn't think of what was said of them and didn't stand on ceremony.  </span><span id="en34147">Possibly, indeed, he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone.  </span><span id="en34149">Above all, not a word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the cook, had not left the kitchen.  </span><span id="en34151">And above all not a word must be said to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on.  </span><span id="en34153">They sat up whispering till two o'clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier, amazed and rather sorrowful. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34156">Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland.  </span><span id="en34158">The rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind.  </span><span id="en34160">He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.  </span><span id="en34162">But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and went towards Y.  </span><span id="en34164">Prospect.  </span><span id="en34166">He walked along that endless street for a long time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side of the street.  </span><span id="en34168">He had noticed passing through this street lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople.  </span><span id="en34170">He was not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark.  </span><span id="en34172">It was a long, blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were lights in the windows and signs of life within.  </span><span id="en34174">He went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room.  </span><span id="en34176">The latter, scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under the stairs.  </span><span id="en34178">There was no other, all were occupied.  </span><span id="en34180">The ragged fellow looked inquiringly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34183">"Is there tea?"  </span><span id="en34185">asked Svidrigaïlov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34188">"Yes, sir." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34191">"What else is there?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34194">"Veal, vodka, savouries." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34197">"Bring me tea and veal." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34200">"And you want nothing else?"  </span><span id="en34202">he asked with apparent surprise. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34205">"Nothing, nothing." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34208">The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34211">"It must be a nice place," thought Svidrigaïlov. " </span><span id="en34213">How was it I didn't know it?  </span><span id="en34215">I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have had some adventure on the way.  </span><span id="en34217">It would be interesting to know who stay here?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34220">He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully.  </span><span id="en34222">It was a room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it; it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained chair and table almost filled it up.  </span><span id="en34224">The walls looked as though they were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general colour—yellow—could still be made out.  </span><span id="en34226">One of the walls was cut short by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under the stairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34229">Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into thought.  </span><span id="en34231">But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention.  </span><span id="en34233">The murmur had not ceased from the moment he entered the room.  </span><span id="en34235">He listened: someone was upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34238">Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through.  </span><span id="en34240">The room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants.  </span><span id="en34242">One of them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast.  </span><span id="en34244">He reproached the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever.  </span><span id="en34246">He declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it all.  </span><span id="en34248">The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can't.  </span><span id="en34250">He sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it.  </span><span id="en34252">A candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs of stale tea.  </span><span id="en34254">After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34257">The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking him again whether he didn't want anything more, and again receiving a negative reply, finally withdrew.  </span><span id="en34259">Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything.  </span><span id="en34261">He began to feel feverish.  </span><span id="en34263">He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the blanket, lay down on the bed.  </span><span id="en34265">He was annoyed. " </span><span id="en34267">It would have been better to be well for the occasion," he thought with a smile.  </span><span id="en34269">The room was close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of leather.  </span><span id="en34271">He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another.  </span><span id="en34273">He felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. " </span><span id="en34275">It must be a garden under the window," he thought. " </span><span id="en34277">There's a sound of trees.  </span><span id="en34279">How I dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark!  </span><span id="en34281">They give one a horrid feeling."  </span><span id="en34283">He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky Park just now.  </span><span id="en34285">This reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. " </span><span id="en34287">I never have liked water," he thought, "even in a landscape," and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea: "Surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but I've become more particular, like an animal that picks out a special place...  </span><span id="en34289">for such an occasion.  </span><span id="en34291">I ought to have gone into the Petrovsky Park!  </span><span id="en34293">I suppose it seemed dark, cold, ha-ha!  </span><span id="en34295">As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!...  </span><span id="en34297">By the way, why haven't I put out the candle?"  </span><span id="en34299">he blew it out. " </span><span id="en34301">They've gone to bed next door," he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. " </span><span id="en34303">Well, now, Marfa Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it's dark, and the very time and place for you.  </span><span id="en34305">But now you won't come!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34308">He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin's keeping. " </span><span id="en34310">I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to tease myself.  </span><span id="en34312">But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is!  </span><span id="en34314">He's gone through a good deal.  </span><span id="en34316">He may be a successful rogue in time when he's got over his nonsense.  </span><span id="en34317">But now he's  </span><i><span id="en34318">too </span></i><span id="en34319">  </span><span id="en34320">eager for life.  </span><span id="en34322">These young men are contemptible on that point.  </span><span id="en34324">But, hang the fellow!  </span><span id="en34326">Let him please himself, it's nothing to do with me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34330">He could not get to sleep.  </span><span id="en34332">By degrees Dounia's image rose before him, and a shudder ran over him. " </span><span id="en34334">No, I must give up all that now," he thought, rousing himself. " </span><span id="en34336">I must think of something else.  </span><span id="en34338">It's queer and funny.  </span><span id="en34340">I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly desired to avenge myself even, and that's a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad sign.  </span><span id="en34342">I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper—that's a bad sign too.  </span><span id="en34344">And the promises I made her just now, too—Damnation!  </span><span id="en34346">But—who knows? </span><span id="en34348">—perhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34351">He ground his teeth and sank into silence again.  </span><span id="en34353">Again Dounia's image rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time, she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her.  </span><span id="en34355">He recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his heart... </span></p>
<p><span id="en34358">"Aïe!  </span><span id="en34360">Damnation, these thoughts again!  </span><span id="en34362">I must put it away!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34365">He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes.  </span><span id="en34367">He started. " </span><span id="en34369">Ugh!  </span><span id="en34371">hang it!  </span><span id="en34373">I believe it's a mouse," he thought, "that's the veal I left on the table."  </span><span id="en34375">He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over his leg again.  </span><span id="en34377">He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle.  </span><span id="en34379">Shaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.  </span><span id="en34381">He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.  </span><span id="en34383">He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and suddenly darted under the pillow.  </span><span id="en34385">He threw down the pillow, but in one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt.  </span><span id="en34387">He trembled nervously and woke up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34390">The room was dark.  </span><span id="en34392">He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before.  </span><span id="en34394">The wind was howling under the window. " </span><span id="en34396">How disgusting," he thought with annoyance. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34399">He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window. " </span><span id="en34401">It's better not to sleep at all," he decided.  </span><span id="en34403">There was a cold damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it.  </span><span id="en34405">He was not thinking of anything and did not want to think.  </span><span id="en34407">But one image rose after another, incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his mind.  </span><span id="en34409">He sank into drowsiness.  </span><span id="en34411">Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic.  </span><span id="en34413">He kept dwelling on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright, warm, almost hot day, a holiday—Trinity day.  </span><span id="en34415">A fine, sumptuous country cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was surrounded with beds of roses.  </span><span id="en34417">A light, cool staircase, carpeted with rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots.  </span><span id="en34419">He noticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks.  </span><span id="en34421">He was reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere—at the windows, the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself—were flowers.  </span><span id="en34423">The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room.  </span><span id="en34425">The birds were chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin.  </span><span id="en34427">The coffin was covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of flowers surrounded it on all sides.  </span><span id="en34429">Among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as though carved out of marble.  </span><span id="en34431">But her loose fair hair was wet; there was a wreath of roses on her head.  </span><span id="en34433">The stern and already rigid profile of her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.  </span><span id="en34435">Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.  </span><span id="en34437">She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken.  </span><span id="en34439">And she had destroyed herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en34442">Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the window.  </span><span id="en34444">He felt for the latch and opened it.  </span><span id="en34446">The wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with his shirt, as though with frost.  </span><span id="en34448">Under the window there must have been something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden.  </span><span id="en34450">There, too, probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime.  </span><span id="en34452">Now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of objects.  </span><span id="en34454">Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill, gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. " </span><span id="en34456">Ah, the signal!  </span><span id="en34458">The river is overflowing," he thought. " </span><span id="en34460">By morning it will be swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and cellars.  </span><span id="en34462">The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys.  </span><span id="en34464">What time is it now?"  </span><span id="en34466">And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34469">"Aha!  </span><span id="en34471">It will be light in an hour!  </span><span id="en34473">Why wait?  </span><span id="en34475">I'll go out at once straight to the park.  </span><span id="en34477">I'll choose a great bush there drenched with rain, so that as soon as one's shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on one's head." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34480">He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle, into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay him for the room and leave the hotel. " </span><span id="en34482">It's the best minute; I couldn't choose a better." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34485">He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive.  </span><span id="en34487">He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel.  </span><span id="en34489">She did not seem afraid of Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes.  </span><span id="en34491">Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted.  </span><span id="en34493">The child's face was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. " </span><span id="en34495">How can she have come here?  </span><span id="en34497">She must have hidden here and not slept all night."  </span><span id="en34499">He began questioning her.  </span><span id="en34501">The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby language, something about "mammy" and that "mammy would beat her," and about some cup that she had "bwoken."  </span><span id="en34503">The child chattered on without stopping.  </span><span id="en34505">He could only guess from what she said that she was a neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken a cup of her mother's and was so frightened that she had run away the evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it.  </span><span id="en34507">He took her in his arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing her.  </span><span id="en34509">The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night.  </span><span id="en34511">When he had undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards.  </span><span id="en34513">She fell asleep at once.  </span><span id="en34515">Then he sank into dreary musing again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34518">"What folly to trouble myself," he decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance. " </span><span id="en34520">What idiocy!"  </span><span id="en34522">In vexation he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away. " </span><span id="en34524">Damn the child!"  </span><span id="en34526">he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again to see whether the child was asleep.  </span><span id="en34528">He raised the blanket carefully.  </span><span id="en34530">The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket, and her pale cheeks were flushed.  </span><span id="en34532">But strange to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. " </span><span id="en34534">It's a flush of fever," thought Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en34536">It was like the flush from drinking, as though she had been given a full glass to drink.  </span><span id="en34538">Her crimson lips were hot and glowing; but what was this?  </span><span id="en34540">He suddenly fancied that her long black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little girl were not asleep, but pretending.  </span><span id="en34542">Yes, it was so.  </span><span id="en34544">Her lips parted in a smile.  </span><span id="en34546">The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to control them.  </span><span id="en34548">But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin, a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the shameless face of a French harlot.  </span><span id="en34550">Now both eyes opened wide; they turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited him....  </span><span id="en34552">There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. " </span><span id="en34554">What, at five years old?"  </span><span id="en34556">Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. " </span><span id="en34558">What does it mean?"  </span><span id="en34560">And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding out her arms.... " </span><span id="en34562">Accursed child!"  </span><span id="en34564">Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand to strike her, but at that moment he woke up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34567">He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket.  </span><span id="en34569">The candle had not been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34572">"I've had nightmare all night!"  </span><span id="en34574">He got up angrily, feeling utterly shattered; his bones ached.  </span><span id="en34576">There was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing.  </span><span id="en34578">It was nearly five.  </span><span id="en34580">He had overslept himself!  </span><span id="en34582">He got up, put on his still damp jacket and overcoat.  </span><span id="en34584">Feeling the revolver in his pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few lines in large letters.  </span><span id="en34586">Reading them over, he sank into thought with his elbows on the table.  </span><span id="en34588">The revolver and the notebook lay beside him.  </span><span id="en34590">Some flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on the table.  </span><span id="en34592">He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began trying to catch one.  </span><span id="en34594">He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.  </span><span id="en34596">At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room.  </span><span id="en34598">A minute later he was in the street. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34601">A thick milky mist hung over the town.  </span><span id="en34603">Svidrigaïlov walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva.  </span><span id="en34605">He was picturing the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island, the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the bush....  </span><span id="en34607">He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think of something else.  </span><span id="en34609">There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.  </span><span id="en34611">The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters.  </span><span id="en34613">The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver.  </span><span id="en34615">From time to time he came across shop signs and read each carefully.  </span><span id="en34617">At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house.  </span><span id="en34619">A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its legs.  </span><span id="en34621">A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead drunk, across the pavement.  </span><span id="en34623">He looked at him and went on.  </span><span id="en34625">A high tower stood up on the left. " </span><span id="en34627">Bah!"  </span><span id="en34629">he shouted, "here is a place.  </span><span id="en34631">Why should it be Petrovsky?  </span><span id="en34633">It will be in the presence of an official witness anyway...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34636">He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where there was the big house with the tower.  </span><span id="en34638">At the great closed gates of the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier's coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his head.  </span><span id="en34640">He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov.  </span><span id="en34642">His face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception.  </span><span id="en34644">They both, Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking.  </span><span id="en34646">At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a word. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34649">"What do you want here?"  </span><span id="en34651">he said, without moving or changing his position. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34654">"Nothing, brother, good morning," answered Svidrigaïlov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34657">"This isn't the place." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34660">"I am going to foreign parts, brother." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34663">"To foreign parts?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34666">"To America." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34669">"America." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34672">Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it.  </span><span id="en34674">Achilles raised his eyebrows. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34677">"I say, this is not the place for such jokes!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34680">"Why shouldn't it be the place?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34683">"Because it isn't." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34686">"Well, brother, I don't mind that.  </span><span id="en34688">It's a good place.  </span><span id="en34690">When you are asked, you just say he was going, he said, to America." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34693">He put the revolver to his right temple. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34696">"You can't do it here, it's not the place," cried Achilles, rousing himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34699">Svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger. </span></p>

<p><span id="en34703">The same day, about seven o'clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on his way to his mother's and sister's lodging—the lodging in Bakaleyev's house which Razumihin had found for them.  </span><span id="en34705">The stairs went up from the street.  </span><span id="en34707">Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still hesitating whether to go or not.  </span><span id="en34709">But nothing would have turned him back: his decision was taken. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34712">"Besides, it doesn't matter, they still know nothing," he thought, "and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34715">He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a night's rain.  </span><span id="en34717">His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours.  </span><span id="en34719">He had spent all the previous night alone, God knows where.  </span><span id="en34721">But anyway he had reached a decision. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34724">He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother.  </span><span id="en34726">Dounia was not at home.  </span><span id="en34728">Even the servant happened to be out.  </span><span id="en34730">At first Pulcheria Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34733">"Here you are!"  </span><span id="en34735">she began, faltering with joy. " </span><span id="en34737">Don't be angry with me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not crying.  </span><span id="en34739">Did you think I was crying?  </span><span id="en34741">No, I am delighted, but I've got into such a stupid habit of shedding tears.  </span><span id="en34743">I've been like that ever since your father's death.  </span><span id="en34745">I cry for anything.  </span><span id="en34747">Sit down, dear boy, you must be tired; I see you are.  </span><span id="en34749">Ah, how muddy you are." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34752">"I was in the rain yesterday, mother...."  </span><span id="en34754">Raskolnikov began. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34757">"No, no," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, "you thought I was going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don't be anxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I've learned the ways here and truly I see for myself that they are better.  </span><span id="en34759">I've made up my mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to give an account of them?  </span><span id="en34761">God knows what concerns and plans you may have, or what ideas you are hatching; so it's not for me to keep nudging your elbow, asking you what you are thinking about?  </span><span id="en34763">But, my goodness!  </span><span id="en34765">why am I running to and fro as though I were crazy...?  </span><span id="en34767">I am reading your article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya.  </span><span id="en34769">Dmitri Prokofitch brought it to me.  </span><span id="en34771">Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: 'There, foolish one,' I thought, 'that's what he is busy about; that's the solution of the mystery!  </span><span id="en34773">Learned people are always like that.  </span><span id="en34775">He may have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I worry him and upset him. </span><span id="en34777">' I read it, my dear, and of course there was a great deal I did not understand; but that's only natural—how should I?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34780">"Show me, mother." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34783">Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article.  </span><span id="en34785">Incongruous as it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three.  </span><span id="en34787">It lasted only a moment.  </span><span id="en34789">After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish.  </span><span id="en34791">He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months.  </span><span id="en34793">He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34796">"But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you will very soon be one of the leading—if not the leading man—in the world of Russian thought.  </span><span id="en34798">And they dared to think you were mad!  </span><span id="en34800">You don't know, but they really thought that.  </span><span id="en34802">Ah, the despicable creatures, how could they understand genius!  </span><span id="en34804">And Dounia, Dounia was all but believing it—what do you say to that?  </span><span id="en34806">Your father sent twice to magazines—the first time poems (I've got the manuscript and will show you) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it out) and how we prayed that they should be taken—they weren't!  </span><span id="en34808">I was breaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living.  </span><span id="en34810">But now I see again how foolish I was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent.  </span><span id="en34812">No doubt you don't care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34815">"Dounia's not at home, mother?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34818">"No, Rodya.  </span><span id="en34820">I often don't see her; she leaves me alone.  </span><span id="en34822">Dmitri Prokofitch comes to see me, it's so good of him, and he always talks about you.  </span><span id="en34824">He loves you and respects you, my dear.  </span><span id="en34826">I don't say that Dounia is very wanting in consideration.  </span><span id="en34828">I am not complaining.  </span><span id="en34830">She has her ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and I never have any secrets from you two.  </span><span id="en34832">Of course, I am sure that Dounia has far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me...  </span><span id="en34834">but I don't know what it will all lead to.  </span><span id="en34836">You've made me so happy by coming now, Rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I'll tell her: 'Your brother came in while you were out.  </span><span id="en34838">Where have you been all this time? </span><span id="en34840">' You mustn't spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can, but if you can't, it doesn't matter, I can wait.  </span><span id="en34842">I shall know, anyway, that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me.  </span><span id="en34844">I shall read what you write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you'll come yourself to see me.  </span><span id="en34846">What could be better?  </span><span id="en34848">Here you've come now to comfort your mother, I see that." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34851">Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34854">"Here I am again!  </span><span id="en34856">Don't mind my foolishness.  </span><span id="en34858">My goodness, why am I sitting here?"  </span><span id="en34860">she cried, jumping up. " </span><span id="en34862">There is coffee and I don't offer you any.  </span><span id="en34864">Ah, that's the selfishness of old age.  </span><span id="en34866">I'll get it at once!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34869">"Mother, don't trouble, I am going at once.  </span><span id="en34871">I haven't come for that.  </span><span id="en34873">Please listen to me." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34876">Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34879">"Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are told about me, will you always love me as you do now?"  </span><span id="en34881">he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and not weighing them. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34884">"Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter?  </span><span id="en34886">How can you ask me such a question?  </span><span id="en34888">Why, who will tell me anything about you?  </span><span id="en34890">Besides, I shouldn't believe anyone, I should refuse to listen." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34893">"I've come to assure you that I've always loved you and I am glad that we are alone, even glad Dounia is out," he went on with the same impulse. " </span><span id="en34895">I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all you thought about me, that I was cruel and didn't care about you, was all a mistake.  </span><span id="en34897">I shall never cease to love you....  </span><span id="en34899">Well, that's enough: I thought I must do this and begin with this...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34902">Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34905">"I don't know what is wrong with you, Rodya," she said at last. " </span><span id="en34907">I've been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that's why you are miserable.  </span><span id="en34909">I've foreseen it a long time, Rodya.  </span><span id="en34911">Forgive me for speaking about it.  </span><span id="en34913">I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights.  </span><span id="en34915">Your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you.  </span><span id="en34917">I caught something, but I couldn't make it out.  </span><span id="en34919">I felt all the morning as though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting something, and now it has come!  </span><span id="en34921">Rodya, Rodya, where are you going?  </span><span id="en34923">You are going away somewhere?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34926">"Yes." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34929">"That's what I thought!  </span><span id="en34931">I can come with you, you know, if you need me.  </span><span id="en34933">And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly—and Sofya Semyonovna may come with us if you like.  </span><span id="en34935">You see, I am glad to look upon her as a daughter even...  </span><span id="en34937">Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.  </span><span id="en34939">But...  </span><span id="en34941">where...  </span><span id="en34943">are you going?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34946">"Good-bye, mother." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34949">"What, to-day?"  </span><span id="en34951">she cried, as though losing him for ever. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34954">"I can't stay, I must go now...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34957">"And can't I come with you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34960">"No, but kneel down and pray to God for me.  </span><span id="en34962">Your prayer perhaps will reach Him." </span></p>
<p><span id="en34965">"Let me bless you and sign you with the cross.  </span><span id="en34967">That's right, that's right.  </span><span id="en34969">Oh, God, what are we doing?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34972">Yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that he was alone with his mother.  </span><span id="en34974">For the first time after all those awful months his heart was softened.  </span><span id="en34976">He fell down before her, he kissed her feet and both wept, embracing.  </span><span id="en34978">And she was not surprised and did not question him this time.  </span><span id="en34980">For some days she had realised that something awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had come for him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en34983">"Rodya, my darling, my first born," she said sobbing, "now you are just as when you were little.  </span><span id="en34985">You would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me.  </span><span id="en34987">When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us simply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we wept together at his grave and embraced, as now.  </span><span id="en34989">And if I've been crying lately, it's that my mother's heart had a foreboding of trouble.  </span><span id="en34991">The first time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived here, I guessed simply from your eyes.  </span><span id="en34993">My heart sank at once, and to-day when I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had come.  </span><span id="en34995">Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en34998">"No!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35001">"You'll come again?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35004">"Yes...  </span><span id="en35006">I'll come." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35009">"Rodya, don't be angry, I don't dare to question you.  </span><span id="en35011">I know I mustn't.  </span><span id="en35013">Only say two words to me—is it far where you are going?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35016">"Very far." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35019">"What is awaiting you there?  </span><span id="en35021">Some post or career for you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35024">"What God sends...  </span><span id="en35026">only pray for me."  </span><span id="en35028">Raskolnikov went to the door, but she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes.  </span><span id="en35030">Her face worked with terror. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35033">"Enough, mother," said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35036">"Not for ever, it's not yet for ever?  </span><span id="en35038">You'll come, you'll come to-morrow?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35041">"I will, I will, good-bye."  </span><span id="en35043">He tore himself away at last. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35046">It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.  </span><span id="en35048">Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste.  </span><span id="en35050">He wanted to finish all before sunset.  </span><span id="en35052">He did not want to meet anyone till then.  </span><span id="en35054">Going up the stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently. " </span><span id="en35056">Can anyone have come to see me?"  </span><span id="en35058">he wondered.  </span><span id="en35060">He had a disgusted vision of Porfiry.  </span><span id="en35062">But opening his door he saw Dounia.  </span><span id="en35064">She was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had been waiting a long time.  </span><span id="en35066">He stopped short in the doorway.  </span><span id="en35068">She rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him.  </span><span id="en35070">Her eyes, fixed upon him, betrayed horror and infinite grief.  </span><span id="en35072">And from those eyes alone he saw at once that she knew. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35075">"Am I to come in or go away?"  </span><span id="en35077">he asked uncertainly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35080">"I've been all day with Sofya Semyonovna.  </span><span id="en35082">We were both waiting for you.  </span><span id="en35084">We thought that you would be sure to come there." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35087">Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35090">"I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35093">He glanced at her mistrustfully. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35096">"Where were you all night?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35099">"I don't remember clearly.  </span><span id="en35101">You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind once for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that I wanted to end it all there, but...  </span><span id="en35103">I couldn't make up my mind," he whispered, looking at her mistrustfully again. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35106">"Thank God!  </span><span id="en35108">That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and I.  </span><span id="en35110">Then you still have faith in life?  </span><span id="en35112">Thank God, thank God!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35115">Raskolnikov smiled bitterly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35118">"I haven't faith, but I have just been weeping in mother's arms; I haven't faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me.  </span><span id="en35120">I don't know how it is, Dounia, I don't understand it." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35123">"Have you been at mother's?  </span><span id="en35125">Have you told her?"  </span><span id="en35127">cried Dounia, horror-stricken. " </span><span id="en35129">Surely you haven't done that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35132">"No, I didn't tell her...  </span><span id="en35134">in words; but she understood a great deal.  </span><span id="en35136">She heard you talking in your sleep.  </span><span id="en35138">I am sure she half understands it already.  </span><span id="en35140">Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her.  </span><span id="en35142">I don't know why I did go.  </span><span id="en35144">I am a contemptible person, Dounia." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35147">"A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering!  </span><span id="en35149">You are, aren't you?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35152">"Yes, I am going.  </span><span id="en35154">At once.  </span><span id="en35156">Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that if I had considered myself strong till now I'd better not be afraid of disgrace," he said, hurrying on. " </span><span id="en35158">It's pride, Dounia." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35161">"Pride, Rodya." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35164">There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35167">"You don't think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?"  </span><span id="en35169">he asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35172">"Oh, Rodya, hush!"  </span><span id="en35174">cried Dounia bitterly.  </span><span id="en35176">Silence lasted for two minutes.  </span><span id="en35178">He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him with anguish.  </span><span id="en35180">Suddenly he got up. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35183">"It's late, it's time to go!  </span><span id="en35185">I am going at once to give myself up.  </span><span id="en35187">But I don't know why I am going to give myself up." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35190">Big tears fell down her cheeks. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35193">"You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35196">"You doubted it?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35199">She threw her arms round him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35202">"Aren't you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?"  </span><span id="en35204">she cried, holding him close and kissing him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35207">"Crime?  </span><span id="en35209">What crime?"  </span><span id="en35211">he cried in sudden fury. " </span><span id="en35213">That I killed a vile noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!...  </span><span id="en35215">Killing her was atonement for forty sins.  </span><span id="en35217">She was sucking the life out of poor people.  </span><span id="en35219">Was that a crime?  </span><span id="en35221">I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking of expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides?  </span><span id="en35223">'A crime!  </span><span id="en35225">a crime! </span><span id="en35227">' Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice, now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace.  </span><span id="en35229">It's simply because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to, perhaps too for my advantage, as that...  </span><span id="en35231">Porfiry...  </span><span id="en35233">suggested!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35236">"Brother, brother, what are you saying?  </span><span id="en35238">Why, you have shed blood?"  </span><span id="en35240">cried Dounia in despair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35243">"Which all men shed," he put in almost frantically, "which flows and has always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind.  </span><span id="en35245">Look into it more carefully and understand it!  </span><span id="en35247">I too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed....  </span><span id="en35249">(Everything seems stupid when it fails. </span><span id="en35251">) By that stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison....  </span><span id="en35253">But I...  </span><span id="en35255">I couldn't carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible, that's what's the matter!  </span><span id="en35257">And yet I won't look at it as you do.  </span><span id="en35259">If I had succeeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I'm trapped." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35262">"But that's not so, not so!  </span><span id="en35264">Brother, what are you saying?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35267">"Ah, it's not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive!  </span><span id="en35269">I fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.  </span><span id="en35271">The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence.  </span><span id="en35273">I've never, never recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever from seeing that what I did was a crime.  </span><span id="en35275">I've never, never been stronger and more convinced than now." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35278">The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered his last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia's eyes and he saw such anguish in them that he could not help being checked.  </span><span id="en35280">He felt that he had, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway, the cause... </span></p>
<p><span id="en35283">"Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven if I am guilty).  </span><span id="en35285">Good-bye!  </span><span id="en35287">We won't dispute.  </span><span id="en35289">It's time, high time to go.  </span><span id="en35291">Don't follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go....  </span><span id="en35293">But you go at once and sit with mother.  </span><span id="en35295">I entreat you to!  </span><span id="en35297">It's my last request of you.  </span><span id="en35299">Don't leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that she is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind.  </span><span id="en35301">Be with her!  </span><span id="en35303">Razumihin will be with you.  </span><span id="en35305">I've been talking to him....  </span><span id="en35307">Don't cry about me: I'll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a murderer.  </span><span id="en35309">Perhaps I shall some day make a name.  </span><span id="en35311">I won't disgrace you, you will see; I'll still show....  </span><span id="en35313">Now good-bye for the present," he concluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia's eyes at his last words and promises. " </span><span id="en35315">Why are you crying?  </span><span id="en35317">Don't cry, don't cry: we are not parting for ever!  </span><span id="en35319">Ah, yes!  </span><span id="en35321">Wait a minute, I'd forgotten!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35324">He went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory.  </span><span id="en35326">It was the portrait of his landlady's daughter, who had died of fever, that strange girl who had wanted to be a nun.  </span><span id="en35328">For a minute he gazed at the delicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave it to Dounia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35331">"I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her," he said thoughtfully. " </span><span id="en35333">To her heart I confided much of what has since been so hideously realised.  </span><span id="en35335">Don't be uneasy," he returned to Dounia, "she was as much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone.  </span><span id="en35337">The great point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to be broken in two," he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection. " </span><span id="en35339">Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it?  </span><span id="en35341">Do I want it myself?  </span><span id="en35343">They say it is necessary for me to suffer!  </span><span id="en35345">What's the object of these senseless sufferings?  </span><span id="en35347">shall I know any better what they are for, when I am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty years' penal servitude?  </span><span id="en35349">And what shall I have to live for then?  </span><span id="en35351">Why am I consenting to that life now?  </span><span id="en35353">Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35356">At last they both went out.  </span><span id="en35358">It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.  </span><span id="en35360">She walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him again.  </span><span id="en35362">He was still in sight.  </span><span id="en35364">At the corner he too turned and for the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him, he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the corner abruptly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35367">"I am wicked, I see that," he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. " </span><span id="en35369">But why are they so fond of me if I don't deserve it?  </span><span id="en35371">Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved me and I too had never loved anyone!  </span><i><span id="en35374">Nothing of all this would have happened. </span></i><span id="en35376">  </span><span id="en35377">But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word that I am a criminal?  </span><span id="en35379">Yes, that's it, that's it, that's what they are sending me there for, that's what they want.  </span><span id="en35381">Look at them running to and fro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and, worse still, an idiot.  </span><span id="en35383">But try to get me off and they'd be wild with righteous indignation.  </span><span id="en35385">Oh, how I hate them all!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35391">He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately—humbled by conviction.  </span><span id="en35393">And yet why not?  </span><span id="en35395">It must be so.  </span><span id="en35397">Would not twenty years of continual bondage crush him utterly?  </span><span id="en35399">Water wears out a stone.  </span><span id="en35401">And why, why should he live after that?  </span><span id="en35403">Why should he go now when he knew that it would be so?  </span><span id="en35405">It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that question since the previous evening, but still he went. </span></p>

<p><span id="en35409">When he went into Sonia's room, it was already getting dark.  </span><span id="en35411">All day Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety.  </span><span id="en35413">Dounia had been waiting with her.  </span><span id="en35415">She had come to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov's words that Sonia knew.  </span><span id="en35417">We will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.  </span><span id="en35419">Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her brother would not be alone.  </span><span id="en35421">He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with him wherever fate might send him.  </span><span id="en35423">Dounia did not ask, but she knew it was so.  </span><span id="en35425">She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her by it.  </span><span id="en35427">Sonia was almost on the point of tears.  </span><span id="en35429">She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at Dounia.  </span><span id="en35431">Dounia's gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35434">Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her brother's room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come there first.  </span><span id="en35436">When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it.  </span><span id="en35438">But they had spent the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both were less anxious while they were together.  </span><span id="en35440">As soon as they parted, each thought of nothing else.  </span><span id="en35442">Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives—Siberia or...  </span><span id="en35444">Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35447">"Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him live?"  </span><span id="en35449">she thought at last in despair. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35452">Meanwhile the sun was setting.  </span><span id="en35454">Sonia was standing in dejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house.  </span><span id="en35456">At last when she began to feel sure of his death—he walked into the room. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35459">She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned pale. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35462">"Yes," said Raskolnikov, smiling. " </span><span id="en35464">I have come for your cross, Sonia.  </span><span id="en35466">It was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened now it's come to that?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35469">Sonia gazed at him astonished.  </span><span id="en35471">His tone seemed strange to her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a mask.  </span><span id="en35473">He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35476">"You see, Sonia, I've decided that it will be better so.  </span><span id="en35478">There is one fact....  </span><span id="en35480">But it's a long story and there's no need to discuss it.  </span><span id="en35482">But do you know what angers me?  </span><span id="en35484">It annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which I shall have to answer—they'll point their fingers at me....  </span><span id="en35486">Tfoo!  </span><span id="en35488">You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him.  </span><span id="en35490">I'd rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise him, what a sensation I shall make!  </span><span id="en35492">But I must be cooler; I've become too irritable of late.  </span><span id="en35494">You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me.  </span><span id="en35496">It's a brutal state to be in!  </span><span id="en35498">Ah!  </span><span id="en35500">what am I coming to!  </span><span id="en35502">Well, where are the crosses?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35505">He seemed hardly to know what he was doing.  </span><span id="en35507">He could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35510">Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress wood and one of copper.  </span><span id="en35512">She made the sign of the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35515">"It's the symbol of my taking up the cross," he laughed. " </span><span id="en35517">As though I had not suffered much till now!  </span><span id="en35519">The wooden cross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta's—you will wear yourself, show me!  </span><span id="en35521">So she had it on...  </span><span id="en35523">at that moment?  </span><span id="en35525">I remember two things like these too, a silver one and a little ikon.  </span><span id="en35527">I threw them back on the old woman's neck.  </span><span id="en35529">Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I ought to put on now....  </span><span id="en35531">But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters; I'm somehow forgetful....  </span><span id="en35533">You see I have come to warn you, Sonia, so that you might know...  </span><span id="en35535">that's all—that's all I came for.  </span><span id="en35537">But I thought I had more to say.  </span><span id="en35539">You wanted me to go yourself.  </span><span id="en35541">Well, now I am going to prison and you'll have your wish.  </span><span id="en35543">Well, what are you crying for?  </span><span id="en35545">You too?  </span><span id="en35547">Don't.  </span><span id="en35549">Leave off!  </span><span id="en35551">Oh, how I hate it all!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35554">But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. " </span><span id="en35556">Why is she grieving too?"  </span><span id="en35558">he thought to himself. " </span><span id="en35560">What am I to her?  </span><span id="en35562">Why does she weep?  </span><span id="en35564">Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia?  </span><span id="en35566">She'll be my nurse." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35569">"Cross yourself, say at least one prayer," Sonia begged in a timid broken voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35572">"Oh certainly, as much as you like!  </span><span id="en35574">And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35577">But he wanted to say something quite different. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35580">He crossed himself several times.  </span><span id="en35582">Sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head.  </span><span id="en35583">It was the green  </span><i><span id="en35584">drap de dames </span></i><span id="en35585">  </span><span id="en35586">shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, "the family shawl."  </span><span id="en35588">Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but he did not ask.  </span><span id="en35590">He began to feel himself that he was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated.  </span><span id="en35592">He was frightened at this.  </span><span id="en35594">He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia meant to go with him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35598">"What are you doing?  </span><span id="en35600">Where are you going?  </span><span id="en35602">Stay here, stay!  </span><span id="en35604">I'll go alone," he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved towards the door. " </span><span id="en35606">What's the use of going in procession?"  </span><span id="en35608">he muttered going out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35611">Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room.  </span><span id="en35613">He had not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her.  </span><span id="en35615">A poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35618">"Was it right, was it right, all this?"  </span><span id="en35620">he thought again as he went down the stairs. " </span><span id="en35622">Couldn't he stop and retract it all...  </span><span id="en35624">and not go?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35627">But still he went.  </span><span id="en35629">He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn't ask himself questions.  </span><span id="en35631">As he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped short for a moment.  </span><span id="en35633">At the same instant, another thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike him then. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35636">"Why, with what object did I go to her just now?  </span><span id="en35638">I told her—on business; on what business?  </span><span id="en35640">I had no sort of business!  </span><span id="en35641">To tell her I was  </span><i><span id="en35642">going </span></i><span id="en35644">; but where was the need?  </span><span id="en35646">Do I love her?  </span><span id="en35648">No, no, I drove her away just now like a dog.  </span><span id="en35650">Did I want her crosses?  </span><span id="en35652">Oh, how low I've sunk!  </span><span id="en35654">No, I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached!  </span><span id="en35656">I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some friendly face to see!  </span><span id="en35658">And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what I would do!  </span><span id="en35660">I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35664">He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go.  </span><span id="en35666">But on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the Hay Market. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35669">He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. " </span><span id="en35671">In another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall I look at the canal then?  </span><span id="en35673">I should like to remember this!"  </span><span id="en35675">slipped into his mind. " </span><span id="en35677">Look at this sign!  </span><span id="en35679">How shall I read those letters then?  </span><span id="en35680">It's written here 'Campany,' that's a thing to remember, that letter  </span><i><span id="en35681">a </span></i><span id="en35683">, and to look at it again in a month—how shall I look at it then?  </span><span id="en35685">What shall I be feeling and thinking then?...  </span><span id="en35687">How trivial it all must be, what I am fretting about now!  </span><span id="en35689">Of course it must all be interesting...  </span><span id="en35691">in its way...  </span><span id="en35693">(Ha-ha-ha!  </span><span id="en35695">What am I thinking about? </span><span id="en35697">) I am becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed?  </span><span id="en35699">Foo!  </span><span id="en35701">how people shove!  </span><span id="en35703">that fat man—a German he must be—who pushed against me, does he know whom he pushed?  </span><span id="en35705">There's a peasant woman with a baby, begging.  </span><span id="en35707">It's curious that she thinks me happier than she is.  </span><span id="en35709">I might give her something, for the incongruity of it.  </span><span id="en35711">Here's a five copeck piece left in my pocket, where did I get it?  </span><span id="en35713">Here, here...  </span><span id="en35715">take it, my good woman!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35719">"God bless you," the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35722">He went into the Hay Market.  </span><span id="en35724">It was distasteful, very distasteful to be in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people.  </span><span id="en35726">He would have given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment.  </span><span id="en35728">There was a man drunk and disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down.  </span><span id="en35730">There was a ring round him.  </span><span id="en35732">Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh.  </span><span id="en35734">A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him, though he still stared.  </span><span id="en35736">He moved away at last, not remembering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming him body and mind. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35739">He suddenly recalled Sonia's words, "Go to the cross-roads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, 'I am a murderer. </span><span id="en35741">'" He trembled, remembering that.  </span><span id="en35743">And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation.  </span><span id="en35745">It came over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through him.  </span><span id="en35747">Everything in him softened at once and the tears started into his eyes.  </span><span id="en35749">He fell to the earth on the spot.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en35752">He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture.  </span><span id="en35754">He got up and bowed down a second time. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35757">"He's boozed," a youth near him observed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35760">There was a roar of laughter. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35763">"He's going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children and his country.  </span><span id="en35765">He's bowing down to all the world and kissing the great city of St.  </span><span id="en35767">Petersburg and its pavement," added a workman who was a little drunk. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35770">"Quite a young man, too!"  </span><span id="en35772">observed a third. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35775">"And a gentleman," someone observed soberly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35778">"There's no knowing who's a gentleman and who isn't nowadays." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35781">These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, "I am a murderer," which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips, died away.  </span><span id="en35783">He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking round, he turned down a street leading to the police office.  </span><span id="en35785">He had a glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt that it must be so.  </span><span id="en35787">The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia.  </span><span id="en35789">She was hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place.  </span><span id="en35791">She had followed him then on his painful way!  </span><span id="en35793">Raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him.  </span><span id="en35795">It wrung his heart...  </span><span id="en35797">but he was just reaching the fatal place. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35800">He went into the yard fairly resolutely.  </span><span id="en35802">He had to mount to the third storey. " </span><span id="en35804">I shall be some time going up," he thought.  </span><span id="en35806">He felt as though the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time left for consideration. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35809">Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming from them.  </span><span id="en35811">Raskolnikov had not been here since that day.  </span><span id="en35813">His legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they moved forward.  </span><span id="en35814">He stopped for a moment to take breath, to collect himself, so as to enter  </span><i><span id="en35815">like a man </span></i><span id="en35817">. "But why?  </span><span id="en35819">what for?"  </span><span id="en35821">he wondered, reflecting. " </span><span id="en35823">If I must drink the cup what difference does it make?  </span><span id="en35825">The more revolting the better."  </span><span id="en35827">He imagined for an instant the figure of the "explosive lieutenant," Ilya Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en35829">Was he actually going to him?  </span><span id="en35831">Couldn't he go to someone else?  </span><span id="en35833">To Nikodim Fomitch?  </span><span id="en35835">Couldn't he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch's lodgings?  </span><span id="en35837">At least then it would be done privately....  </span><span id="en35839">No, no!  </span><span id="en35841">To the "explosive lieutenant"!  </span><span id="en35843">If he must drink it, drink it off at once. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35847">Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.  </span><span id="en35849">There were very few people in it this time—only a house porter and a peasant.  </span><span id="en35851">The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.  </span><span id="en35853">Raskolnikov walked into the next room. " </span><span id="en35855">Perhaps I still need not speak," passed through his mind.  </span><span id="en35857">Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write.  </span><span id="en35859">In a corner another clerk was seating himself.  </span><span id="en35861">Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35864">"No one in?"  </span><span id="en35866">Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35869">"Whom do you want?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35872">"A-ah!  </span><span id="en35874">Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the Russian...  </span><span id="en35876">how does it go on in the fairy tale...  </span><span id="en35878">I've forgotten!  </span><span id="en35880">'At your service! </span><span id="en35882">'" a familiar voice cried suddenly. </span></p>
<p><span id="en35885">Raskolnikov shuddered.  </span><span id="en35887">The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him.  </span><span id="en35889">He had just come in from the third room. " </span><span id="en35891">It is the hand of fate," thought Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en35893">Why is he here?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35896">"You've come to see us?  </span><span id="en35898">What about?"  </span><span id="en35900">cried Ilya Petrovitch.  </span><span id="en35902">He was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated. " </span><span id="en35904">If it's on business you are rather early. </span><span id="en35906">[*] It's only a chance that I am here...  </span><span id="en35908">however I'll do what I can.  </span><span id="en35910">I must admit, I...  </span><span id="en35912">what is it, what is it?  </span><span id="en35914">Excuse me...." </span></p>

<p><span id="en35941">"Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch!  </span><span id="en35943">I was just getting at it.  </span><span id="en35945">I made many inquiries about you.  </span><span id="en35947">I assure you I've been genuinely grieved since that...  </span><span id="en35949">since I behaved like that...  </span><span id="en35951">it was explained to me afterwards that you were a literary man...  </span><span id="en35953">and a learned one too...  </span><span id="en35955">and so to say the first steps...  </span><span id="en35957">Mercy on us!  </span><span id="en35959">What literary or scientific man does not begin by some originality of conduct!  </span><span id="en35961">My wife and I have the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it's a genuine passion!  </span><span id="en35963">Literature and art!  </span><span id="en35965">If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius.  </span><span id="en35967">As for a hat—well, what does a hat matter?  </span><span id="en35969">I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but what's under the hat, what the hat covers, I can't buy that!  </span><span id="en35971">I was even meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you'd...  </span><span id="en35973">But I am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really?  </span><span id="en35975">I hear your family have come?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35978">"Yes, my mother and sister." </span></p>
<p><span id="en35981">"I've even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister—a highly cultivated and charming person.  </span><span id="en35983">I confess I was sorry I got so hot with you.  </span><span id="en35985">There it is!  </span><span id="en35987">But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting fit—that affair has been cleared up splendidly!  </span><span id="en35989">Bigotry and fanaticism!  </span><span id="en35991">I understand your indignation.  </span><span id="en35993">Perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family's arriving?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en35996">"No, I only looked in...  </span><span id="en35998">I came to ask...  </span><span id="en36000">I thought that I should find Zametov here." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36003">"Oh, yes!  </span><span id="en36005">Of course, you've made friends, I heard.  </span><span id="en36007">Well, no, Zametov is not here.  </span><span id="en36009">Yes, we've lost Zametov.  </span><span id="en36011">He's not been here since yesterday...  </span><span id="en36013">he quarrelled with everyone on leaving...  </span><span id="en36015">in the rudest way.  </span><span id="en36017">He is a feather-headed youngster, that's all; one might have expected something from him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.  </span><span id="en36019">He wanted to go in for some examination, but it's only to talk and boast about it, it will go no further than that.  </span><span id="en36021">Of course it's a very different matter with you or Mr.  </span><span id="en36023">Razumihin there, your friend.  </span><span id="en36025">Your career is an intellectual one and you won't be deterred by failure.  </span><span id="en36026">For you, one may say, all the attractions of life  </span><i><span id="en36027">nihil est </span></i><span id="en36029">—you are an ascetic, a monk, a hermit!...  </span><span id="en36031">A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned research—that's where your spirit soars!  </span><span id="en36033">I am the same way myself....  </span><span id="en36035">Have you read Livingstone's Travels?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36039">"No." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36042">"Oh, I have.  </span><span id="en36044">There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know, and indeed it is not to be wondered at.  </span><span id="en36046">What sort of days are they?  </span><span id="en36048">I ask you.  </span><span id="en36050">But we thought...  </span><span id="en36052">you are not a Nihilist of course?  </span><span id="en36054">Answer me openly, openly!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36057">"N-no..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36060">"Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!  </span><span id="en36062">Official duty is one thing but...  </span><span id="en36063">you are thinking I meant to say  </span><i><span id="en36064">friendship </span></i><span id="en36065">  </span><span id="en36066">is quite another?  </span><span id="en36068">No, you're wrong!  </span><span id="en36070">It's not friendship, but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of love for the Almighty.  </span><span id="en36072">I may be an official, but I am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen....  </span><span id="en36074">You were asking about Zametov.  </span><span id="en36076">Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad reputation, over a glass of champagne...  </span><span id="en36078">that's all your Zametov is good for!  </span><span id="en36080">While I'm perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post!  </span><span id="en36082">I am married and have children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is he, may I ask?  </span><span id="en36084">I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education...  </span><span id="en36086">Then these midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36090">Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly.  </span><span id="en36092">The words of Ilya Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a stream of empty sounds for him.  </span><span id="en36094">But some of them he understood.  </span><span id="en36096">He looked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36099">"I mean those crop-headed wenches," the talkative Ilya Petrovitch continued. " </span><span id="en36101">Midwives is my name for them.  </span><span id="en36103">I think it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha!  </span><span id="en36105">They go to the Academy, study anatomy.  </span><span id="en36107">If I fall ill, am I to send for a young lady to treat me?  </span><span id="en36109">What do you say?  </span><span id="en36111">Ha-ha!"  </span><span id="en36113">Ilya Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. " </span><span id="en36115">It's an immoderate zeal for education, but once you're educated, that's enough.  </span><span id="en36117">Why abuse it?  </span><span id="en36119">Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does?  </span><span id="en36121">Why did he insult me, I ask you?  </span><span id="en36123">Look at these suicides, too, how common they are, you can't fancy!  </span><span id="en36125">People spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves, boys and girls and old people.  </span><span id="en36127">Only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town.  </span><span id="en36129">Nil Pavlitch, I say, what was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36132">"Svidrigaïlov," someone answered from the other room with drowsy listlessness. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36135">Raskolnikov started. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36138">"Svidrigaïlov!  </span><span id="en36140">Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!"  </span><span id="en36142">he cried. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36145">"What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36148">"Yes...  </span><span id="en36150">I knew him....  </span><span id="en36152">He hadn't been here long." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36155">"Yes, that's so.  </span><span id="en36157">He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way....  </span><span id="en36159">He left in his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame for his death.  </span><span id="en36161">He had money, they say.  </span><span id="en36163">How did you come to know him?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36166">"I...  </span><span id="en36168">was acquainted...  </span><span id="en36170">my sister was governess in his family." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36173">"Bah-bah-bah!  </span><span id="en36175">Then no doubt you can tell us something about him.  </span><span id="en36177">You had no suspicion?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36180">"I saw him yesterday...  </span><span id="en36182">he...  </span><span id="en36184">was drinking wine; I knew nothing." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36187">Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling him. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36190">"You've turned pale again.  </span><span id="en36192">It's so stuffy here..." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36195">"Yes, I must go," muttered Raskolnikov. " </span><span id="en36197">Excuse my troubling you...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36200">"Oh, not at all, as often as you like.  </span><span id="en36202">It's a pleasure to see you and I am glad to say so." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36205">Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36208">"I only wanted...  </span><span id="en36210">I came to see Zametov." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36213">"I understand, I understand, and it's a pleasure to see you." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36216">"I...  </span><span id="en36218">am very glad...  </span><span id="en36220">good-bye," Raskolnikov smiled. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36223">He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know what he was doing.  </span><span id="en36225">He began going down the stairs, supporting himself with his right hand against the wall.  </span><span id="en36227">He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a rolling-pin at it and shouted.  </span><span id="en36229">He went down and out into the yard.  </span><span id="en36231">There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.  </span><span id="en36233">She looked wildly at him.  </span><span id="en36235">He stood still before her.  </span><span id="en36237">There was a look of poignant agony, of despair, in her face.  </span><span id="en36239">She clasped her hands.  </span><span id="en36241">His lips worked in an ugly, meaningless smile.  </span><span id="en36243">He stood still a minute, grinned and went back to the police office. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36246">Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers.  </span><span id="en36248">Before him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36251">"Hulloa!  </span><span id="en36253">Back again!  </span><span id="en36255">have you left something behind?  </span><span id="en36257">What's the matter?" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36260">Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.  </span><span id="en36262">He walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say something, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36265">"You are feeling ill, a chair!  </span><span id="en36267">Here, sit down!  </span><span id="en36269">Some water!" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36272">Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise.  </span><span id="en36274">Both looked at one another for a minute and waited.  </span><span id="en36276">Water was brought. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36279">"It was I..."  </span><span id="en36281">began Raskolnikov. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36284">"Drink some water." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36286">Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly, but distinctly said: </span></p>
<p><span id="en36287">" </span><i><span id="en36289">It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them. </span></i><span id="en36291">" </span></p>
<p><span id="en36296">Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth.  </span><span id="en36298">People ran up on all sides. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36301">Raskolnikov repeated his statement. </span></p>

<p><span id="en36306">Siberia.  </span><span id="en36308">On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of the administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress, in the fortress there is a prison.  </span><span id="en36310">In the prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months.  </span><span id="en36312">Almost a year and a half has passed since his crime. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36315">There had been little difficulty about his trial.  </span><span id="en36317">The criminal adhered exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement.  </span><span id="en36319">He did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit the smallest detail.  </span><span id="en36320">He explained every incident of the murder, the secret of  </span><i><span id="en36321">the pledge </span></i><span id="en36322">  </span><span id="en36323">(the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which was found in the murdered woman's hand.  </span><span id="en36325">He described minutely how he had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its contents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta's murder; described how Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home.  </span><span id="en36327">He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.  </span><span id="en36329">The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear.  </span><span id="en36331">The lawyers and the judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how many there were.  </span><span id="en36333">The fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible.  </span><span id="en36335">There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks.  </span><span id="en36337">From being so long under the stone, some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the damp.  </span><span id="en36339">They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession.  </span><span id="en36341">Finally some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse, and so didn't know what was in it when he hid it under the stone.  </span><span id="en36343">But they immediately drew the deduction that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of gain.  </span><span id="en36345">This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases.  </span><span id="en36347">Moreover Raskolnikov's hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by Dr.  </span><span id="en36349">Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.  </span><span id="en36351">All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another element in the case. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36355">To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself.  </span><span id="en36357">To the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding.  </span><span id="en36359">He had been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by privation and failure.  </span><span id="en36361">To the question what led him to confess, he answered that it was his heartfelt repentance.  </span><span id="en36363">All this was almost coarse.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en36366">The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected, perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself, but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt.  </span><span id="en36368">All the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.  </span><span id="en36370">There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition of the criminal at the time.  </span><span id="en36372">The fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime.  </span><span id="en36374">Incidentally the murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open!  </span><span id="en36376">Finally, the confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism, and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)—all this did much to soften the sentence.  </span><span id="en36378">Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner's favour came out quite unexpectedly.  </span><span id="en36380">Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year, Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died.  </span><span id="en36382">Raskolnikov's landlady bore witness, too, that when they had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so.  </span><span id="en36384">This was investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses.  </span><span id="en36386">These facts made an impression in his favour. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36389">And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight years only. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36392">At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov's mother fell ill.  </span><span id="en36394">Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the trial.  </span><span id="en36396">Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible.  </span><span id="en36398">Pulcheria Alexandrovna's illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36401">When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium.  </span><span id="en36403">That evening Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother's questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother's benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia on a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and reputation. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36406">But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter.  </span><span id="en36408">On the contrary, she had her own version of her son's sudden departure; she told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding.  </span><span id="en36410">As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed.  </span><span id="en36412">She assured Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it.  </span><span id="en36414">This article she was continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36417">They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna's strange silence on certain subjects.  </span><span id="en36419">She did not, for instance, complain of getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya.  </span><span id="en36421">This was the cause of great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son's fate and was afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful.  </span><span id="en36423">In any case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of her faculties. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36426">It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood lasted for a long time.  </span><span id="en36428">Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible.  </span><span id="en36430">Dounia remembered her brother's telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?  </span><span id="en36432">Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his future....  </span><span id="en36434">Her fancies were sometimes very strange.  </span><span id="en36436">They humoured her, pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending), but she still went on talking. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36439">Five months after Raskolnikov's confession, he was sentenced.  </span><span id="en36441">Razumihin and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible.  </span><span id="en36443">At last the moment of separation came.  </span><span id="en36445">Dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same.  </span><span id="en36447">Razumihin, in his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital.  </span><span id="en36449">There they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would begin a new life.  </span><span id="en36451">They all wept at parting. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36454">Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before.  </span><span id="en36456">He asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her.  </span><span id="en36458">He worried so much about her that it alarmed Dounia.  </span><span id="en36460">When he heard about his mother's illness he became very gloomy.  </span><span id="en36462">With Sonia he was particularly reserved all the time.  </span><span id="en36464">With the help of the money left to her by Svidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia.  </span><span id="en36466">Not a word passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it would be so.  </span><span id="en36468">At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his sister's and Razumihin's fervent anticipations of their happy future together when he should come out of prison.  </span><span id="en36470">He predicted that their mother's illness would soon have a fatal ending.  </span><span id="en36472">Sonia and he at last set off. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36475">Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin.  </span><span id="en36477">It was a quiet and sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.  </span><span id="en36479">During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.  </span><span id="en36481">Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she could not but believe in him.  </span><span id="en36483">He displayed a rare strength of will.  </span><span id="en36485">Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order to take his degree.  </span><span id="en36487">They were continually making plans for the future; both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least.  </span><span id="en36489">Till then they rested their hopes on Sonia. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36492">Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia's marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious.  </span><span id="en36494">To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little children from a fire.  </span><span id="en36496">These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna's disordered imagination almost to ecstasy.  </span><span id="en36498">She was continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with strangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her.  </span><span id="en36500">In public conveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on!  </span><span id="en36502">Dounia did not know how to restrain her.  </span><span id="en36504">Apart from the danger of her morbid excitement, there was the risk of someone's recalling Raskolnikov's name and speaking of the recent trial.  </span><span id="en36506">Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36509">At last her restlessness reached an extreme point.  </span><span id="en36511">She would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious.  </span><span id="en36513">One morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home, that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must expect him back in nine months.  </span><span id="en36515">She began to prepare for his coming, began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and put up new hangings and so on.  </span><span id="en36517">Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room.  </span><span id="en36519">After a fatiguing day spent in continual fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.  </span><span id="en36521">It was brain fever.  </span><span id="en36523">She died within a fortnight.  </span><span id="en36525">In her delirium she dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son's terrible fate than they had supposed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36528">For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother's death, though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached Siberia.  </span><span id="en36530">It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity.  </span><span id="en36532">At first they found Sonia's letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother's life.  </span><span id="en36534">Sonia's letters were full of the most matter-of-fact detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov's surroundings as a convict.  </span><span id="en36536">There was no word of her own hopes, no conjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings.  </span><span id="en36538">Instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the simple facts—that is, his own words, an exact account of his health, what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her and so on.  </span><span id="en36540">All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness.  </span><span id="en36542">The picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and precision.  </span><span id="en36544">There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but facts. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36547">But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news, especially at first.  </span><span id="en36549">Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it, not externally at any rate.  </span><span id="en36551">She told them that, although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off from everyone—he took a very direct and simple view of his new life; that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time, had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he had known before.  </span><span id="en36553">She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent about food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have his own tea every day.  </span><span id="en36555">He begged her not to trouble about anything else, declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him.  </span><span id="en36557">Sonia wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement.  </span><span id="en36559">But that he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply from inattention and indifference. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36562">Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits, had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and rude to her.  </span><span id="en36564">But that in the end these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when she was ill for some days and could not visit him.  </span><span id="en36566">She used to see him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her.  </span><span id="en36568">On working days she would go to see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the sheds on the banks of the Irtish. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36571">About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses.  </span><span id="en36573">But she did not mention that the authorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task was lightened and so on. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36576">At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone, that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale.  </span><span id="en36578">In the last letter Sonia wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital. </span></p>
<h3 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@2554@2554-h@2554-h-19_htm_html_pgepubid00051"><span id="en36580">II </span></h3>
<p><span id="en36582">He was ill a long time.  </span><span id="en36584">But it was not the horrors of prison life, not the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes that crushed him.  </span><span id="en36586">What did he care for all those trials and hardships!  </span><span id="en36588">he was even glad of the hard work.  </span><span id="en36590">Physically exhausted, he could at least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep.  </span><span id="en36592">And what was the food to him—the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it?  </span><span id="en36594">In the past as a student he had often not had even that.  </span><span id="en36596">His clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life.  </span><span id="en36598">He did not even feel the fetters.  </span><span id="en36600">Was he ashamed of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat?  </span><span id="en36602">Before whom?  </span><span id="en36604">Before Sonia?  </span><span id="en36606">Sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her?  </span><span id="en36608">And yet he was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with his contemptuous rough manner.  </span><span id="en36610">But it was not his shaven head and his fetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick.  </span><span id="en36612">It was wounded pride that made him ill.  </span><span id="en36614">Oh, how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself!  </span><span id="en36616">He could have borne anything then, even shame and disgrace.  </span><span id="en36617">But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except a simple  </span><i><span id="en36618">blunder </span></i><span id="en36619">  </span><span id="en36620">which might happen to anyone.  </span><span id="en36622">He was ashamed just because he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to "the idiocy" of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36626">Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing—that was all that lay before him.  </span><span id="en36628">And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life!  </span><span id="en36630">What had he to live for?  </span><span id="en36632">What had he to look forward to?  </span><span id="en36634">Why should he strive?  </span><span id="en36636">To live in order to exist?  </span><span id="en36638">Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.  </span><span id="en36640">Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted more.  </span><span id="en36642">Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36645">And if only fate would have sent him repentance—burning repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning!  </span><span id="en36647">Oh, he would have been glad of it!  </span><span id="en36649">Tears and agonies would at least have been life.  </span><span id="en36651">But he did not repent of his crime. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36654">At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.  </span><span id="en36655">But now in prison,  </span><i><span id="en36656">in freedom </span></i><span id="en36658">, he thought over and criticised all his actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque as they had seemed at the fatal time. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36662">"In what way," he asked himself, "was my theory stupider than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world?  </span><span id="en36664">One has only to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced by commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so...  </span><span id="en36666">strange.  </span><span id="en36668">Oh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way! </span></p>
<p><span id="en36671">"Why does my action strike them as so horrible?"  </span><span id="en36673">he said to himself. " </span><span id="en36675">Is it because it was a crime?  </span><span id="en36677">What is meant by crime?  </span><span id="en36679">My conscience is at rest.  </span><span id="en36681">Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed.  </span><span id="en36683">Well, punish me for the letter of the law...  </span><span id="en36685">and that's enough.  </span><span id="en36687">Of course, in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps.  </span><span id="en36688">But those men succeeded and so  </span><i><span id="en36689">they were right </span></i><span id="en36691">, and I didn't, and so I had no right to have taken that step." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36695">It was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36698">He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself?  </span><span id="en36700">Why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess?  </span><span id="en36702">Was the desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it?  </span><span id="en36704">Had not Svidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death? </span></p>
<p><span id="en36707">In misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that, at the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions.  </span><span id="en36709">He didn't understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future resurrection. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36712">He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not step over, again through weakness and meanness.  </span><span id="en36714">He looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it.  </span><span id="en36716">It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom.  </span><span id="en36718">What terrible agonies and privations some of them, the tramps for instance, had endured!  </span><span id="en36720">Could they care so much for a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush?  </span><span id="en36722">As he went on he saw still more inexplicable examples. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36725">In prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes.  </span><span id="en36727">It was loathsome and unbearable for him to look.  </span><span id="en36729">But in the end there was much that surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much that he had not suspected before.  </span><span id="en36731">What surprised him most of all was the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest.  </span><span id="en36733">They seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility.  </span><span id="en36735">He felt and knew the reasons of his isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong.  </span><span id="en36737">There were some Polish exiles, political prisoners, among them.  </span><span id="en36739">They simply looked down upon all the rest as ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.  </span><span id="en36741">He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the Poles.  </span><span id="en36743">There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former officer and two seminarists.  </span><span id="en36745">Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.  </span><span id="en36747">He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at last—why, he could not tell.  </span><span id="en36749">Men who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36752">"You're a gentleman," they used to say. " </span><span id="en36754">You shouldn't hack about with an axe; that's not a gentleman's work." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36757">The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his gang.  </span><span id="en36759">He went to church and prayed with the others.  </span><span id="en36761">A quarrel broke out one day, he did not know how.  </span><span id="en36763">All fell on him at once in a fury. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36766">"You're an infidel!  </span><span id="en36768">You don't believe in God," they shouted. " </span><span id="en36770">You ought to be killed." </span></p>
<p><span id="en36773">He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to kill him as an infidel.  </span><span id="en36775">He said nothing.  </span><span id="en36777">One of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy.  </span><span id="en36779">Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently; his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch.  </span><span id="en36781">The guard succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would have been bloodshed. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36784">There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so fond of Sonia?  </span><span id="en36786">She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met them, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment.  </span><span id="en36787">And yet everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow  </span><i><span id="en36788">him </span></i><span id="en36790">, knew how and where she lived.  </span><span id="en36792">She never gave them money, did them no particular services.  </span><span id="en36794">Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents of pies and rolls.  </span><span id="en36796">But by degrees closer relations sprang up between them and Sonia.  </span><span id="en36798">She would write and post letters for them to their relations.  </span><span id="en36800">Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them.  </span><span id="en36802">Their wives and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her.  </span><span id="en36804">And when she visited Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they all took off their hats to her. " </span><span id="en36806">Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you are our dear, good little mother," coarse branded criminals said to that frail little creature.  </span><span id="en36808">She would smile and bow to them and everyone was delighted when she smiled.  </span><span id="en36810">They even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in fact, did not know what to admire her most for.  </span><span id="en36812">They even came to her for help in their illnesses. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36816">He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter.  </span><span id="en36818">When he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious.  </span><span id="en36820">He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of Asia.  </span><span id="en36822">All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen.  </span><span id="en36824">Some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will.  </span><span id="en36826">Men attacked by them became at once mad and furious.  </span><span id="en36828">But never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their moral convictions so infallible.  </span><span id="en36830">Whole villages, whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection.  </span><span id="en36832">All were excited and did not understand one another.  </span><span id="en36834">Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung his hands.  </span><span id="en36836">They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom to justify.  </span><span id="en36838">Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite.  </span><span id="en36840">They gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting and devouring each other.  </span><span id="en36842">The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew.  </span><span id="en36844">The most ordinary trades were abandoned, because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they could not agree.  </span><span id="en36846">The land too was abandoned.  </span><span id="en36848">Men met in groups, agreed on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed.  </span><span id="en36850">They accused one another, fought and killed each other.  </span><span id="en36852">There were conflagrations and famine.  </span><span id="en36854">All men and all things were involved in destruction.  </span><span id="en36856">The plague spread and moved further and further.  </span><span id="en36858">Only a few men could be saved in the whole world.  </span><span id="en36860">They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these men, no one had heard their words and their voices. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36863">Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.  </span><span id="en36865">The second week after Easter had come.  </span><span id="en36867">There were warm bright spring days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened.  </span><span id="en36869">Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was difficult.  </span><span id="en36871">But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36874">One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep.  </span><span id="en36876">On waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospital gate.  </span><span id="en36878">She seemed to be waiting for someone.  </span><span id="en36880">Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute.  </span><span id="en36882">He shuddered and moved away from the window.  </span><span id="en36884">Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily.  </span><span id="en36886">At last he was discharged.  </span><span id="en36888">On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36891">He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous.  </span><span id="en36893">Hearing that he was anxious about her, Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better, that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and see him at his work.  </span><span id="en36895">His heart throbbed painfully as he read it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36898">Again it was a warm bright day.  </span><span id="en36900">Early in the morning, at six o'clock, he went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed.  </span><span id="en36902">There were only three of them sent.  </span><span id="en36904">One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln.  </span><span id="en36906">Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river.  </span><span id="en36908">From the high bank a broad landscape opened before him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.  </span><span id="en36910">In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black specks, the nomads' tents.  </span><span id="en36912">There there was freedom, there other men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.  </span><span id="en36914">Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him.  </span><span id="en36916">Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side.  </span><span id="en36918">It was still quite early; the morning chill was still keen.  </span><span id="en36920">She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler.  </span><span id="en36922">She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand with her usual timidity.  </span><span id="en36924">She was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would repel it.  </span><span id="en36926">He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit.  </span><span id="en36928">Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved.  </span><span id="en36930">But now their hands did not part.  </span><span id="en36932">He stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking.  </span><span id="en36934">They were alone, no one had seen them.  </span><span id="en36936">The guard had turned away for the time. </span></p>
<a id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@2554@2554-h@2554-h-20_htm_html"></a><p><span id="en36939">How it happened he did not know.  </span><span id="en36941">But all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet.  </span><span id="en36943">He wept and threw his arms round her knees.  </span><span id="en36945">For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale.  </span><span id="en36947">She jumped up and looked at him trembling.  </span><span id="en36949">But at the same moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes.  </span><span id="en36951">She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come.... </span></p>
<p><span id="en36954">They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes.  </span><span id="en36956">They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life.  </span><span id="en36958">They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36961">They resolved to wait and be patient.  </span><span id="en36963">They had another seven years to wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them!  </span><span id="en36965">But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being, while she—she only lived in his life. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36968">On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked, Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her.  </span><span id="en36970">He had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way.  </span><span id="en36972">He remembered that now, and thought it was bound to be so.  </span><span id="en36974">Wasn't everything now bound to be changed? </span></p>
<p><span id="en36977">He thought of her.  </span><span id="en36979">He remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart.  </span><span id="en36981">He remembered her pale and thin little face.  </span><span id="en36983">But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings.  </span><span id="en36984">And what were all,  </span><i><span id="en36985">all </span></i><span id="en36986">  </span><span id="en36987">the agonies of the past!  </span><span id="en36989">Everything, even his crime, his sentence and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external, strange fact with which he had no concern.  </span><span id="en36991">But he could not think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling.  </span><span id="en36993">Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind. </span></p>
<p><span id="en36997">Under his pillow lay the New Testament.  </span><span id="en36999">He took it up mechanically.  </span><span id="en37001">The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him.  </span><span id="en37003">At first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with books.  </span><span id="en37005">But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the Testament.  </span><span id="en37007">He had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word.  </span><span id="en37009">Till now he had not opened it. </span></p>
<p><span id="en37012">He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: "Can her convictions not be mine now?  </span><span id="en37014">Her feelings, her aspirations at least...." </span></p>
<p><span id="en37017">She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken ill again.  </span><span id="en37019">But she was so happy—and so unexpectedly happy—that she was almost frightened of her happiness.  </span><span id="en37020">Seven years,  </span><i><span id="en37021">only </span></i><span id="en37022">  </span><span id="en37023">seven years!  </span><span id="en37025">At the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days.  </span><span id="en37027">He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering. </span></p>
<p><span id="en37031">But that is the beginning of a new story—the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.  </span><span id="en37033">That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is ended. </span></p>
