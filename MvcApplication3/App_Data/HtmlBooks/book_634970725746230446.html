<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-0_htm_html_pgepubid00003">I. The Period</h2>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p><span id="en98"> we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way— in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</span></p>
<p><span id="en99"> There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France.</span><span id="en100"> In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.</span></p>
<p><span id="en101"> It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.</span><span id="en102"> Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this.</span><span id="en103"> Mrs.</span><span id="en104"> Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster.</span><span id="en105"> Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.</span><span id="en106"> Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.</span></p>
<p><span id="en107"> France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.</span><span id="en108"> Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards.</span><span id="en109"> It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history.</span><span id="en110"> It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution.</span><span id="en111"> But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.</span></p>
<p><span id="en112"> In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting.</span><span id="en113"> Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of "the Captain," gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, "in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:" after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St.</span><span id="en114"> Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.</span><span id="en115"> In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en116"> All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.</span><span id="en117"> Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand.</span><span id="en118"> Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—the creatures of this chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay before them.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-0_htm_html_pgepubid00004">II. The Mail</h2>
<p><span id="en119"> It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.</span><span id="en120"> The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill.</span><span id="en121"> He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.</span><span id="en122"> Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.</span></p>
<p><span id="en123"> With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints.</span><span id="en124"> As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary "Wo-ho!</span><span id="en125"> so-ho-then!"</span><span id="en126"> the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it—like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill.</span><span id="en127"> Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en128"> There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none.</span><span id="en129"> A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.</span><span id="en130"> It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.</span></p>
<p><span id="en131"> Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail.</span><span id="en132"> All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots.</span><span id="en133"> Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions.</span><span id="en134"> In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers.</span><span id="en135"> As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in "the Captain's" pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards.</span><span id="en136"> So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.</span></p>
<p><span id="en137"> The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.</span></p>
<p><span id="en138"> "Wo-ho!"</span><span id="en139"> said the coachman.</span><span id="en140"> "So, then!</span><span id="en141"> One more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!</span><span id="en142"> —Joe!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en143"> "Halloa!"</span><span id="en144"> the guard replied.</span></p>
<p><span id="en145"> "What o'clock do you make it, Joe?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en146"> "Ten minutes, good, past eleven."</span></p>
<p><span id="en147"> "My blood!"</span><span id="en148"> ejaculated the vexed coachman, "and not atop of Shooter's yet!</span><span id="en149"> Tst!</span><span id="en150"> Yah!</span><span id="en151"> Get on with you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en152"> The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit.</span><span id="en153"> Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side.</span><span id="en154"> They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it.</span><span id="en155"> If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.</span></p>
<p><span id="en156"> The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill.</span><span id="en157"> The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.</span></p>
<p><span id="en158"> "Tst!</span><span id="en159"> Joe!"</span><span id="en160"> cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box.</span></p>
<p><span id="en161"> "What do you say, Tom?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en162"> They both listened.</span></p>
<p><span id="en163"> "I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe."</span></p>
<p><span id="en164"> "I say a horse at a gallop, Tom," returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place.</span><span id="en165"> "Gentlemen!</span><span id="en166"> In the king's name, all of you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en167"> With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive.</span></p>
<p><span id="en168"> The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow.</span><span id="en169"> He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him.</span><span id="en170"> They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened.</span><span id="en171"> The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.</span></p>
<p><span id="en172"> The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.</span><span id="en173"> The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation.</span><span id="en174"> The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en175"> The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.</span></p>
<p><span id="en176"> "So-ho!"</span><span id="en177"> the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar.</span><span id="en178"> "Yo there!</span><span id="en179"> Stand!</span><span id="en180"> I shall fire!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en181"> The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, "Is that the Dover mail?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en182"> "Never you mind what it is!"</span><span id="en183"> the guard retorted.</span><span id="en184"> "What are you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en185"> "Is that the Dover mail?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en186"> "Why do you want to know?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en187"> "I want a passenger, if it is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en188"> "What passenger?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en189"> "Mr.</span><span id="en190"> Jarvis Lorry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en191"> Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name.</span><span id="en192"> The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.</span></p>
<p><span id="en193"> "Keep where you are," the guard called to the voice in the mist, "because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime.</span><span id="en194"> Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight."</span></p>
<p><span id="en195"> "What is the matter?"</span><span id="en196"> asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech.</span><span id="en197"> "Who wants me?</span><span id="en198"> Is it Jerry?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en199"> ("I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry," growled the guard to himself.</span><span id="en200"> "He's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en201"> "Yes, Mr.</span><span id="en202"> Lorry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en203"> "What is the matter?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en204"> "A despatch sent after you from over yonder.</span><span id="en205"> . and Co."</span></p>
<p><span id="en206"> "I know this messenger, guard," said Mr.</span><span id="en207"> Lorry, getting down into the road—assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window.</span><span id="en208"> "He may come close; there's nothing wrong."</span></p>
<p><span id="en209"> "I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that," said the guard, in gruff soliloquy.</span><span id="en210"> "Hallo you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en211"> "Well!</span><span id="en212"> And hallo you!"</span><span id="en213"> said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.</span></p>
<p><span id="en214"> "Come on at a footpace!</span><span id="en215"> d'ye mind me?</span><span id="en216"> And if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em.</span><span id="en217"> For I'm a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead.</span><span id="en218"> So now let's look at you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en219"> The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood.</span><span id="en220"> The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper.</span><span id="en221"> The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.</span></p>
<p><span id="en222"> "Guard!"</span><span id="en223"> said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en224"> The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, "Sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en225"> "There is nothing to apprehend.</span><span id="en226"> I belong to Tellson's Bank.</span><span id="en227"> You must know Tellson's Bank in London.</span><span id="en228"> I am going to Paris on business.</span><span id="en229"> A crown to drink.</span><span id="en230"> I may read this?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en231"> "If so be as you're quick, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en232"> He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read—first to himself and then aloud: "'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.</span><span id="en233"> ' It's not long, you see, guard.</span><span id="en234"> Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE."</span></p>
<p><span id="en235"> Jerry started in his saddle.</span><span id="en236"> "That's a Blazing strange answer, too," said he, at his hoarsest.</span></p>
<p><span id="en237"> "Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote.</span><span id="en238"> Make the best of your way.</span><span id="en239"> Good night."</span></p>
<p><span id="en240"> With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep.</span><span id="en241"> With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.</span></p>
<p><span id="en242"> The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent.</span><span id="en243"> The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box.</span><span id="en244"> For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en245"> "Tom!"</span><span id="en246"> softly over the coach roof.</span></p>
<p><span id="en247"> "Hallo, Joe."</span></p>
<p><span id="en248"> "Did you hear the message?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en249"> "I did, Joe."</span></p>
<p><span id="en250"> "What did you make of it, Tom?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en251"> "Nothing at all, Joe."</span></p>
<p><span id="en252"> "That's a coincidence, too," the guard mused, "for I made the same of it myself."</span></p>
<p><span id="en253"> Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon.</span><span id="en254"> After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.</span></p>
<p><span id="en255"> "After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level," said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare.</span><span id="en256"> "'Recalled to life.</span><span id="en257"> ' That's a Blazing strange message.</span><span id="en258"> Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry!</span><span id="en259"> I say, Jerry!</span><span id="en260"> You'd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!"</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-0_htm_html_pgepubid00005">III. The Night Shadows</h2>
<p><span id="en261"> A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.</span><span id="en262"> A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!</span><span id="en263"> Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this.</span><span id="en264"> No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all.</span><span id="en265"> No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged.</span><span id="en266"> It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page.</span><span id="en267"> It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore.</span><span id="en268"> My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end.</span><span id="en269"> In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?</span></p>
<p><span id="en270"> As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London.</span><span id="en271"> So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next.</span></p>
<p><span id="en272"> The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes.</span><span id="en273"> He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together—as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart.</span><span id="en274"> They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees.</span><span id="en275"> When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en276"> "No, Jerry, no!"</span><span id="en277"> said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.</span><span id="en278"> "It wouldn't do for you, Jerry.</span><span id="en279"> Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't suit your line of business!</span><span id="en280"> Recalled—!</span><span id="en281"> Bust me if I don't think he'd been a drinking!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en282"> His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head.</span><span id="en283"> Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose.</span><span id="en284"> It was so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.</span></p>
<p><span id="en285"> While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness.</span><span id="en286"> They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.</span></p>
<p><span id="en287"> What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside.</span><span id="en288"> To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.</span></p>
<p><span id="en289"> Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail.</span><span id="en290"> As the bank passenger—with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt—nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business.</span><span id="en291"> The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time.</span><span id="en292"> Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en293"> But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night.</span><span id="en294"> He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.</span></p>
<p><span id="en295"> Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state.</span><span id="en296"> Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures.</span><span id="en297"> But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white.</span></p>
<p><span id="en298"> "Buried how long?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en299"> The answer was always the same: "Almost eighteen years."</span></p>
<p><span id="en300"> "You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en301"> "Long ago."</span></p>
<p><span id="en302"> "You know that you are recalled to life?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en303"> "They tell me so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en304"> "I hope you care to live?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en305"> "I can't say."</span></p>
<p><span id="en306"> "Shall I show her to you?</span><span id="en307"> Will you come and see her?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en308"> The answers to this question were various and contradictory.</span><span id="en309"> Sometimes the broken reply was, "Wait!</span><span id="en310"> It would kill me if I saw her too soon."</span><span id="en311"> Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was, "Take me to her."</span><span id="en312"> Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, "I don't know her.</span><span id="en313"> I don't understand."</span></p>
<p><span id="en314"> After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dig—now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his hands—to dig this wretched creature out.</span><span id="en315"> Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust.</span><span id="en316"> The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.</span></p>
<p><span id="en317"> Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within.</span><span id="en318"> The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there.</span><span id="en319"> Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en320"> "Buried how long?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en321"> "Almost eighteen years."</span></p>
<p><span id="en322"> "I hope you care to live?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en323"> "I can't say."</span></p>
<p><span id="en324"> Dig—dig—dig—until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave.</span></p>
<p><span id="en325"> "Buried how long?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en326"> "Almost eighteen years."</span></p>
<p><span id="en327"> "You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en328"> "Long ago."</span></p>
<p><span id="en329"> The words were still in his hearing as just spoken—distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life—when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone.</span></p>
<p><span id="en330"> He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun.</span><span id="en331"> There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees.</span><span id="en332"> Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span id="en333"> "Eighteen years!"</span><span id="en334"> said the passenger, looking at the sun.</span><span id="en335"> "Gracious Creator of day!</span><span id="en336"> To be buried alive for eighteen years!"</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-0_htm_html_pgepubid00006">IV. The Preparation</h2>
<p><span id="en337"> When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was.</span><span id="en338"> He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.</span></p>
<p><span id="en339"> By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations.</span><span id="en340"> The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dog-kennel.</span><span id="en341"> Mr.</span><span id="en342"> Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.</span></p>
<p><span id="en343"> "There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en344"> "Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair.</span><span id="en345"> The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir.</span><span id="en346"> Bed, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en347"> "I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber."</span></p>
<p><span id="en348"> "And then breakfast, sir?</span><span id="en349"> Yes, sir.</span><span id="en350"> That way, sir, if you please.</span><span id="en351"> Show Concord!</span><span id="en352"> Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord.</span><span id="en353"> Pull off gentleman's boots in Concord.</span><span id="en354"> (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.</span><span id="en355"> ) Fetch barber to Concord.</span><span id="en356"> Stir about there, now, for Concord!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en357"> The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it.</span><span id="en358"> Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span id="en359"> The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown.</span><span id="en360"> His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.</span></p>
<p><span id="en361"> Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire.</span><span id="en362"> He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim.</span><span id="en363"> He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.</span><span id="en364"> His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea.</span><span id="en365"> A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson's Bank.</span><span id="en366"> He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.</span><span id="en367"> But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.</span></p>
<p><span id="en368"> Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr.</span><span id="en369"> Lorry dropped off to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span id="en370"> "I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day.</span><span id="en371"> She may ask for Mr.</span><span id="en372"> Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank.</span><span id="en373"> Please to let me know."</span></p>
<p><span id="en374"> "Yes, sir.</span><span id="en375"> Tellson's Bank in London, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en376"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en377"> "Yes, sir.</span><span id="en378"> We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir.</span><span id="en379"> A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House."</span></p>
<p><span id="en380"> "Yes.</span><span id="en381"> We are quite a French House, as well as an English one."</span></p>
<p><span id="en382"> "Yes, sir.</span><span id="en383"> Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en384"> "Not of late years.</span><span id="en385"> It is fifteen years since we—since I—came last from France."</span></p>
<p><span id="en386"> "Indeed, sir?</span><span id="en387"> That was before my time here, sir.</span><span id="en388"> Before our people's time here, sir.</span><span id="en389"> The George was in other hands at that time, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en390"> "I believe so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en391"> "But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years ago?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en392"> "You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from the truth."</span></p>
<p><span id="en393"> "Indeed, sir!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en394"> Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower.</span><span id="en395"> According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.</span></p>
<p><span id="en396"> When Mr.</span><span id="en397"> Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach.</span><span id="en398"> The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich.</span><span id="en399"> The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction.</span><span id="en400"> It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly.</span><span id="en401"> The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea.</span><span id="en402"> A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood.</span><span id="en403"> Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.</span></p>
<p><span id="en404"> As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr.</span><span id="en405"> Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud too.</span><span id="en406"> When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.</span></p>
<p><span id="en407"> A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.</span><span id="en408"> Mr.</span><span id="en409"> Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.</span></p>
<p><span id="en410"> He set down his glass untouched.</span><span id="en411"> "This is Mam'selle!"</span><span id="en412"> said he.</span></p>
<p><span id="en413"> In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson's.</span></p>
<p><span id="en414"> "So soon?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en415"> Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.</span></p>
<p><span id="en416"> The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment.</span><span id="en417"> It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables.</span><span id="en418"> These had been oiled and oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if they were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en419"> The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr.</span><span id="en420"> Lorry, picking his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand.</span><span id="en421"> As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions—as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high.</span><span id="en422"> The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender—and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.</span></p>
<p><span id="en423"> "Pray take a seat, sir."</span><span id="en424"> In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en425"> "I kiss your hand, miss," said Mr.</span><span id="en426"> Lorry, with the manners of an earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.</span></p>

<p><span id="en427"> "The word is not material, miss; either word will do."</span></p>

<p><span id="en428"> Mr.</span><span id="en429"> Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids.</span><span id="en430"> As if they had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets!</span></p>
<p><span id="en431"> "—rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose."</span></p>
<p><span id="en432"> "Myself."</span></p>
<p><span id="en433"> "As I was prepared to hear, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en434"> She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she.</span><span id="en435"> He made her another bow.</span></p>
<p><span id="en436"> "I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection.</span><span id="en437"> The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en438"> "I was happy," said Mr.</span><span id="en439"> Lorry, "to be entrusted with the charge.</span><span id="en440"> I shall be more happy to execute it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en441"> "Sir, I thank you indeed.</span><span id="en442"> I thank you very gratefully.</span><span id="en443"> It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature.</span><span id="en444"> I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are."</span></p>
<p><span id="en445"> "Naturally," said Mr.</span><span id="en446"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en447"> After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears, "It is very difficult to begin."</span></p>
<p><span id="en448"> He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance.</span><span id="en449"> The young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression—but it was pretty and characteristic, besides being singular—and she raised her hand, as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing shadow.</span></p>
<p><span id="en450"> "Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en451"> "Am I not?"</span><span id="en452"> Mr.</span><span id="en453"> Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile.</span></p>
<p><span id="en454"> Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing.</span></p>
<p><span id="en455"> "In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you as a young English lady, Miss Manette?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en456"> "If you please, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en457"> "Miss Manette, I am a man of business.</span><span id="en458"> I have a business charge to acquit myself of.</span><span id="en459"> In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine—truly, I am not much else.</span><span id="en460"> I will, with your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers."</span></p>
<p><span id="en461"> "Story!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en462"> He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, "Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers.</span><span id="en463"> He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements—a Doctor."</span></p>
<p><span id="en464"> "Not of Beauvais?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en465"> "Why, yes, of Beauvais.</span><span id="en466"> Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of Beauvais.</span><span id="en467"> Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of repute in Paris.</span><span id="en468"> I had the honour of knowing him there.</span><span id="en469"> Our relations were business relations, but confidential.</span><span id="en470"> I was at that time in our French House, and had been—oh!</span><span id="en471"> twenty years."</span></p>
<p><span id="en472"> "At that time—I may ask, at what time, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en473"> "I speak, miss, of twenty years ago.</span><span id="en474"> He married—an English lady—and I was one of the trustees.</span><span id="en475"> His affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands.</span><span id="en476"> In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers.</span><span id="en477"> These are mere business relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment.</span><span id="en478"> I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine.</span></p>
<p><span id="en479"> "But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think"—the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him—"that when I was left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years, it was you who brought me to England.</span><span id="en480"> I am almost sure it was you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en481"> Mr.</span><span id="en482"> Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips.</span><span id="en483"> He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his.</span></p>
<p><span id="en484"> "Miss Manette, it was I.</span><span id="en485"> And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect that I have never seen you since.</span><span id="en486"> No; you have been the ward of Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson's House since.</span><span id="en487"> Feelings!</span><span id="en488"> I have no time for them, no chance of them.</span><span id="en489"> I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle."</span></p>
<p><span id="en490"> After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr.</span><span id="en491"> Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude.</span></p>
<p><span id="en492"> "So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father.</span><span id="en493"> Now comes the difference.</span><span id="en494"> If your father had not died when he did—Don't be frightened!</span><span id="en495"> How you start!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en496"> She did, indeed, start.</span><span id="en497"> And she caught his wrist with both her hands.</span></p>
<p><span id="en498"> "Pray," said Mr.</span><span id="en499"> Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble: "pray control your agitation—a matter of business.</span></p>

<p><span id="en500"> "As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;—then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais."</span></p>
<p><span id="en501"> "I entreat you to tell me more, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en502"> "I will.</span><span id="en503"> I am going to.</span><span id="en504"> You can bear it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en505"> "I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment."</span></p>
<p><span id="en506"> "You speak collectedly, and you—are collected.</span><span id="en507"> That's good!"</span><span id="en508"> (Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.</span><span id="en509"> ) "A matter of business.</span><span id="en510"> Regard it as a matter of business—business that must be done.</span></p>
<p><span id="en511"> "The little child was a daughter, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en512"> "A daughter.</span><span id="en513"> A-a-matter of business—don't be distressed.</span><span id="en514"> Miss, if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born, that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead—No, don't kneel!</span><span id="en515"> In Heaven's name why should you kneel to me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en516"> "For the truth.</span><span id="en517"> O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en518"> "A—a matter of business.</span><span id="en519"> You confuse me, and how can I transact business if I am confused?</span><span id="en520"> Let us be clear-headed.</span><span id="en521"> If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging.</span><span id="en522"> I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind."</span></p>
<p><span id="en523"> Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to Mr.</span><span id="en524"> Jarvis Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en525"> "That's right, that's right.</span><span id="en526"> Courage!</span><span id="en527"> Business!</span><span id="en528"> You have business before you; useful business.</span><span id="en529"> Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you.</span><span id="en530"> And when she died—I believe broken-hearted—having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years."</span></p>
<p><span id="en531"> As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.</span></p>
<p><span id="en532"> "You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you.</span></p>
<p><span id="en533"> He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped.</span><span id="en534"> The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.</span></p>
<p><span id="en535"> "But he has been—been found.</span><span id="en536"> He is alive.</span><span id="en537"> Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.</span><span id="en538"> Still, alive.</span><span id="en539"> Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort."</span></p>
<p><span id="en540"> A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his.</span></p>
<p><span id="en541"> "I am going to see his Ghost!</span><span id="en542"> It will be his Ghost—not him!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en543"> Mr.</span><span id="en544"> Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm.</span><span id="en545"> "There, there, there!</span><span id="en546"> See now, see now!</span><span id="en547"> The best and the worst are known to you, now.</span><span id="en548"> You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side."</span></p>
<p><span id="en549"> She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, "I have been free, I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en550"> "Only one thing more," said Mr.</span><span id="en551"> Lorry, laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention: "he has been found under another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed.</span><span id="en552"> It would be worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly held prisoner.</span><span id="en553"> It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous.</span><span id="en554"> Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him—for a while at all events—out of France.</span><span id="en555"> Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter.</span><span id="en556"> I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it.</span><span id="en557"> This is a secret service altogether.</span><span id="en558"> My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, 'Recalled to Life;' which may mean anything.</span><span id="en559"> But what is the matter!</span><span id="en560"> She doesn't notice a word!</span><span id="en561"> Miss Manette!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en562"> Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead.</span><span id="en563"> So close was her hold upon his arm, that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving.</span></p>
<p><span id="en564"> A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr.</span><span id="en565"> Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him flying back against the nearest wall.</span></p>
<p><span id="en566"> ("I really think this must be a man!"</span><span id="en567"> was Mr.</span><span id="en568"> Lorry's breathless reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span id="en569"> "Why, look at you all!"</span><span id="en570"> bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.</span><span id="en571"> "Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring at me?</span><span id="en572"> I am not so much to look at, am I?</span><span id="en573"> Why don't you go and fetch things?</span><span id="en574"> I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will."</span></p>
<p><span id="en575"> There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and gentleness: calling her "my precious!"</span><span id="en576"> and "my bird!"</span><span id="en577"> and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.</span></p>
<p><span id="en578"> "And you in brown!"</span><span id="en579"> she said, indignantly turning to Mr.</span><span id="en580"> Lorry; "couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death?</span><span id="en581"> Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands.</span><span id="en582"> Do you call that being a Banker?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en583"> Mr.</span><span id="en584"> Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of "letting them know" something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span id="en585"> "I hope she will do well now," said Mr.</span><span id="en586"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en587"> "No thanks to you in brown, if she does.</span><span id="en588"> My darling pretty!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en589"> "I hope," said Mr.</span><span id="en590"> Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, "that you accompany Miss Manette to France?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en591"> "A likely thing, too!"</span><span id="en592"> replied the strong woman.</span><span id="en593"> "If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en594"> This being another question hard to answer, Mr.</span><span id="en595"> Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-1_htm_html_pgepubid00007">V. The Wine-shop</h2>
<p><span id="en596"> A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street.</span><span id="en597"> The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.</span></p>
<p><span id="en598"> All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine.</span><span id="en599"> The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size.</span><span id="en600"> Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers.</span><span id="en601"> Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish.</span><span id="en602"> There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en603"> A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices—voices of men, women, and children—resounded in the street while this wine game lasted.</span><span id="en604"> There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness.</span><span id="en605"> There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together.</span><span id="en606"> When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out.</span><span id="en607"> The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.</span></p>
<p><span id="en608"> The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled.</span><span id="en609"> It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes.</span><span id="en610"> The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.</span><span id="en611"> Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees—BLOOD.</span></p>
<p><span id="en612"> The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.</span></p>
<p><span id="en613"> And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy—cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence—nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last.</span><span id="en614"> Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook.</span><span id="en615"> The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, Hunger.</span><span id="en616"> It was prevalent everywhere.</span><span id="en617"> Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat.</span><span id="en618"> Hunger was the inscription on the baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale.</span><span id="en619"> Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.</span></p>
<p><span id="en620"> Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it.</span><span id="en621"> A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill.</span><span id="en622"> In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay.</span><span id="en623"> Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting.</span><span id="en624"> The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want.</span><span id="en625"> The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves.</span><span id="en626"> The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together.</span><span id="en627"> Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker's stock was murderous.</span><span id="en628"> The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors.</span><span id="en629"> The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street—when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses.</span><span id="en630"> Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea.</span><span id="en631"> Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.</span></p>
<p><span id="en632"> For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition.</span><span id="en633"> But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.</span></p>
<p><span id="en634"> The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine.</span><span id="en635"> "It's not my affair," said he, with a final shrug of the shoulders.</span><span id="en636"> "The people from the market did it.</span><span id="en637"> Let them bring another."</span></p>

<p><span id="en638"> "Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en639"> The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe.</span><span id="en640"> It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too.</span></p>
<p><span id="en641"> "What now?</span><span id="en642"> Are you a subject for the mad hospital?"</span><span id="en643"> said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it.</span><span id="en644"> "Why do you write in the public streets?</span><span id="en645"> Is there—tell me thou—is there no other place to write such words in?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en646"> In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the joker's heart.</span><span id="en647"> The joker rapped it with his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand, and held out.</span><span id="en648"> A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span id="en649"> "Put it on, put it on," said the other.</span><span id="en650"> "Call wine, wine; and finish there."</span><span id="en651"> With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's dress, such as it was—quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.</span></p>
<p><span id="en652"> This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.</span><span id="en653"> His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to the elbows.</span><span id="en654"> Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair.</span><span id="en655"> He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them.</span><span id="en656"> Good-humoured looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn the man.</span></p>
<p><span id="en657"> Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in.</span><span id="en658"> Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of manner.</span><span id="en659"> There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided.</span><span id="en660"> Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings.</span><span id="en661"> Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick.</span><span id="en662"> Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough.</span><span id="en663"> This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.</span></p>
<p><span id="en664"> The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in a corner.</span><span id="en665"> Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine.</span><span id="en666"> As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, "This is our man."</span></p>
<p><span id="en667"> "What the devil do you do in that galley there?"</span><span id="en668"> said Monsieur Defarge to himself; "I don't know you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en669"> But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.</span></p>
<p><span id="en670"> "How goes it, Jacques?"</span><span id="en671"> said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge.</span><span id="en672"> "Is all the spilt wine swallowed?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en673"> "Every drop, Jacques," answered Monsieur Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en674"> When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.</span></p>
<p><span id="en675"> "It is not often," said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, "that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death.</span><span id="en676"> Is it not so, Jacques?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en677"> "It is so, Jacques," Monsieur Defarge returned.</span></p>
<p><span id="en678"> At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.</span></p>
<p><span id="en679"> The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips.</span></p>
<p><span id="en680"> "Ah!</span><span id="en681"> So much the worse!</span><span id="en682"> A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques.</span><span id="en683"> Am I right, Jacques?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en684"> "You are right, Jacques," was the response of Monsieur Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en685"> This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.</span></p>
<p><span id="en686"> "Hold then!</span><span id="en687"> True!"</span><span id="en688"> muttered her husband.</span><span id="en689"> "Gentlemen—my wife!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en690"> The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes.</span><span id="en691"> She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look.</span><span id="en692"> Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en693"> "Gentlemen," said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, "good day.</span><span id="en694"> The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor.</span><span id="en695"> The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here," pointing with his hand, "near to the window of my establishment.</span><span id="en696"> But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show the way.</span><span id="en697"> Gentlemen, adieu!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en698"> They paid for their wine, and left the place.</span><span id="en699"> The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.</span></p>
<p><span id="en700"> "Willingly, sir," said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to the door.</span></p>
<p><span id="en701"> Their conference was very short, but very decided.</span><span id="en702"> Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive.</span><span id="en703"> It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out.</span><span id="en704"> The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out.</span><span id="en705"> Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.</span></p>
<p><span id="en706"> Mr.</span><span id="en707"> Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before.</span><span id="en708"> It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people.</span><span id="en709"> In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips.</span><span id="en710"> It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds.</span><span id="en711"> He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man.</span></p>
<p><span id="en712"> "It is very high; it is a little difficult.</span><span id="en713"> Better to begin slowly."</span><span id="en714"> Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr.</span><span id="en715"> Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span id="en716"> "Is he alone?"</span><span id="en717"> the latter whispered.</span></p>
<p><span id="en718"> "Alone!</span><span id="en719"> God help him, who should be with him!"</span><span id="en720"> said the other, in the same low voice.</span></p>
<p><span id="en721"> "Is he always alone, then?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en722"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en723"> "Of his own desire?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en724"> "Of his own necessity.</span><span id="en725"> As he was, when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be discreet—as he was then, so he is now."</span></p>
<p><span id="en726"> "He is greatly changed?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en727"> "Changed!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en728"> The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand, and mutter a tremendous curse.</span><span id="en729"> No direct answer could have been half so forcible.</span><span id="en730"> Mr.</span><span id="en731"> Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher.</span></p>
<p><span id="en732"> Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses.</span><span id="en733"> Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building—that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase—left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own windows.</span><span id="en734"> The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable.</span><span id="en735"> Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay.</span><span id="en736"> Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.</span><span id="en737"> Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest.</span><span id="en738"> Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in.</span><span id="en739"> Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.</span></p>
<p><span id="en740"> At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time.</span><span id="en741"> There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was reached.</span><span id="en742"> The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr.</span><span id="en743"> Lorry took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.</span></p>
<p><span id="en744"> "The door is locked then, my friend?"</span><span id="en745"> said Mr.</span><span id="en746"> Lorry, surprised.</span></p>
<p><span id="en747"> "Ay.</span><span id="en748"> Yes," was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en749"> "You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en750"> "I think it necessary to turn the key."</span><span id="en751"> Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.</span></p>
<p><span id="en752"> "Why?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en753"> "Why!</span><span id="en754"> Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened—rave—tear himself to pieces—die—come to I know not what harm—if his door was left open."</span></p>
<p><span id="en755"> "Is it possible!"</span><span id="en756"> exclaimed Mr.</span><span id="en757"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en758"> "Is it possible!"</span><span id="en759"> repeated Defarge, bitterly.</span><span id="en760"> "Yes.</span><span id="en761"> And a beautiful world we live in, when it is possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done—done, see you!</span><span id="en762"> —under that sky there, every day.</span><span id="en763"> Long live the Devil.</span><span id="en764"> Let us go on."</span></p>
<p><span id="en765"> This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears.</span><span id="en766"> But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr.</span><span id="en767"> Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.</span></p>
<p><span id="en768"> "Courage, dear miss!</span><span id="en769"> Courage!</span><span id="en770"> Business!</span><span id="en771"> The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over.</span><span id="en772"> Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin.</span><span id="en773"> Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.</span><span id="en774"> That's well, friend Defarge.</span><span id="en775"> Come, now.</span><span id="en776"> Business, business!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en777"> They went up slowly and softly.</span><span id="en778"> The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top.</span><span id="en779"> There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall.</span><span id="en780"> On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop.</span></p>
<p><span id="en781"> "I forgot them in the surprise of your visit," explained Monsieur Defarge.</span><span id="en782"> "Leave us, good boys; we have business here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en783"> The three glided by, and went silently down.</span></p>
<p><span id="en784"> There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en785"> "Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en786"> "I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few."</span></p>
<p><span id="en787"> "Is that well?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en788"> "I think it is well."</span></p>
<p><span id="en789"> "Who are the few?</span><span id="en790"> How do you choose them?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en791"> "I choose them as real men, of my name—Jacques is my name—to whom the sight is likely to do good.</span><span id="en792"> Enough; you are English; that is another thing.</span><span id="en793"> Stay there, if you please, a little moment."</span></p>
<p><span id="en794"> With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall.</span><span id="en795"> Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door—evidently with no other object than to make a noise there.</span><span id="en796"> With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could.</span></p>
<p><span id="en797"> The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the room and said something.</span><span id="en798"> A faint voice answered something.</span><span id="en799"> Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.</span></p>
<p><span id="en800"> He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter.</span><span id="en801"> Mr.</span><span id="en802"> Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he felt that she was sinking.</span></p>
<p><span id="en803"> "A-a-a-business, business!"</span><span id="en804"> he urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek.</span><span id="en805"> "Come in, come in!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en806"> "I am afraid of it," she answered, shuddering.</span></p>
<p><span id="en807"> "Of it?</span><span id="en808"> What?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en809"> "I mean of him.</span><span id="en810"> Of my father."</span></p>
<p><span id="en811"> Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room.</span><span id="en812"> He sat her down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en813"> Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside, took out the key again, and held it in his hand.</span><span id="en814"> All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make.</span><span id="en815"> Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was.</span><span id="en816"> He stopped there, and faced round.</span></p>
<p><span id="en817"> The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction.</span><span id="en818"> To exclude the cold, one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.</span><span id="en819"> Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity.</span><span id="en820"> Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-1_htm_html_pgepubid00008">VI. The Shoemaker</h2>
<p><span id="en821"> "Good day!"</span><span id="en822"> said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking.</span></p>

<p><span id="en823"> "Good day!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en824"> "You are still hard at work, I see?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en825"> After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, "Yes—I am working."</span><span id="en826"> This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en827"> The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful.</span><span id="en828"> It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it.</span><span id="en829"> Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse.</span><span id="en830"> It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago.</span><span id="en831"> So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain.</span><span id="en832"> So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground.</span><span id="en833"> So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.</span></p>
<p><span id="en834"> Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.</span></p>
<p><span id="en835"> "I want," said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, "to let in a little more light here.</span><span id="en836"> You can bear a little more?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en837"> The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span id="en838"> "What did you say?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en839"> "You can bear a little more light?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en840"> "I must bear it, if you let it in."</span><span id="en841"> (Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.</span></p>
<p><span id="en842"> The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time.</span><span id="en843"> A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour.</span><span id="en844"> His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench.</span><span id="en845"> He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes.</span><span id="en846"> The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.</span><span id="en847"> His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn.</span><span id="en848"> He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.</span></p>
<p><span id="en849"> He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones of it seemed transparent.</span><span id="en850"> So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze, pausing in his work.</span><span id="en851"> He never looked at the figure before him, without first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.</span></p>
<p><span id="en852"> "Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?"</span><span id="en853"> asked Defarge, motioning to Mr.</span><span id="en854"> Lorry to come forward.</span></p>
<p><span id="en855"> "What did you say?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en856"> "Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en857"> "I can't say that I mean to.</span><span id="en858"> I suppose so.</span><span id="en859"> I don't know."</span></p>
<p><span id="en860"> But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en861"> Mr.</span><span id="en862"> Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door.</span><span id="en863"> When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up.</span><span id="en864"> He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe.</span><span id="en865"> The look and the action had occupied but an instant.</span></p>
<p><span id="en866"> "You have a visitor, you see," said Monsieur Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en867"> "What did you say?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en868"> "Here is a visitor."</span></p>
<p><span id="en869"> The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his work.</span></p>
<p><span id="en870"> "Come!"</span><span id="en871"> said Defarge.</span><span id="en872"> "Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one.</span><span id="en873"> Show him that shoe you are working at.</span><span id="en874"> Take it, monsieur."</span></p>
<p><span id="en875"> Mr.</span><span id="en876"> Lorry took it in his hand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en877"> "Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name."</span></p>

<p><span id="en878"> "I forget what it was you asked me.</span><span id="en879"> What did you say?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en880"> "I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's information?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en881"> "It is a lady's shoe.</span><span id="en882"> It is a young lady's walking-shoe.</span><span id="en883"> It is in the present mode.</span><span id="en884"> I never saw the mode.</span><span id="en885"> I have had a pattern in my hand."</span><span id="en886"> He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.</span></p>
<p><span id="en887"> "And the maker's name?"</span><span id="en888"> said Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en889"> Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission.</span><span id="en890"> The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man.</span></p>
<p><span id="en891"> "Did you ask me for my name?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en892"> "Assuredly I did."</span></p>
<p><span id="en893"> "One Hundred and Five, North Tower."</span></p>
<p><span id="en894"> "Is that all?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en895"> "One Hundred and Five, North Tower."</span></p>
<p><span id="en896"> With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again broken.</span></p>
<p><span id="en897"> "You are not a shoemaker by trade?"</span><span id="en898"> said Mr.</span><span id="en899"> Lorry, looking steadfastly at him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en900"> His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.</span></p>
<p><span id="en901"> "I am not a shoemaker by trade?</span><span id="en902"> No, I was not a shoemaker by trade.</span><span id="en903"> I-I learnt it here.</span><span id="en904"> I taught myself.</span></p>
<p><span id="en905"> He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time.</span><span id="en906"> His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en907"> "I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after a long while, and I have made shoes ever since."</span></p>
<p><span id="en908"> As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en909"> "Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en910"> The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.</span></p>
<p><span id="en911"> "Monsieur Manette"; Mr.</span><span id="en912"> Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; "do you remember nothing of this man?</span><span id="en913"> Look at him.</span><span id="en914"> Look at me.</span><span id="en915"> Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en916"> As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.</span><span id="en917"> Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him.</span><span id="en918"> They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there.</span><span id="en919"> And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope—so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en920"> Darkness had fallen on him in its place.</span><span id="en921"> He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way.</span><span id="en922"> Finally, with a deep long sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.</span></p>
<p><span id="en923"> "Have you recognised him, monsieur?"</span><span id="en924"> asked Defarge in a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span id="en925"> "Yes; for a moment.</span><span id="en926"> At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so well.</span><span id="en927"> Hush!</span><span id="en928"> Let us draw further back.</span><span id="en929"> Hush!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en930"> She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on which he sat.</span><span id="en931"> There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour.</span></p>
<p><span id="en932"> Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made.</span><span id="en933"> She stood, like a spirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.</span></p>
<p><span id="en934"> It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand, for his shoemaker's knife.</span><span id="en935"> It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood.</span><span id="en936"> He had taken it up, and was stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress.</span><span id="en937"> He raised them, and saw her face.</span><span id="en938"> The two spectators started forward, but she stayed them with a motion of her hand.</span><span id="en939"> She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife, though they had.</span></p>
<p><span id="en940"> He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en941"> "What is this?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en942"> With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she laid his ruined head there.</span></p>
<p><span id="en943"> "You are not the gaoler's daughter?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en944"> She sighed "No."</span></p>
<p><span id="en945"> "Who are you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en946"> Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench beside him.</span><span id="en947"> He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm.</span><span id="en948"> A strange thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en949"> Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed aside, and fell down over her neck.</span><span id="en950"> Advancing his hand by little and little, he took it up and looked at it.</span><span id="en951"> In the midst of the action he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.</span></p>
<p><span id="en952"> But not for long.</span><span id="en953"> Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his shoulder.</span><span id="en954"> After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it.</span><span id="en955"> He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.</span></p>
<p><span id="en956"> He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it.</span><span id="en957"> "It is the same.</span><span id="en958"> How can it be!</span><span id="en959"> When was it!</span><span id="en960"> How was it!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en961"> As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too.</span><span id="en962"> He turned her full to the light, and looked at her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en963"> "She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned out—she had a fear of my going, though I had none—and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve.</span><span id="en964"> 'You will leave me them?</span><span id="en965"> They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.</span><span id="en966"> ' Those were the words I said.</span><span id="en967"> I remember them very well."</span></p>
<p><span id="en968"> He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.</span><span id="en969"> But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently, though slowly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en970"> "How was this?</span><span id="en971"> —Was it you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en972"> Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness.</span><span id="en973"> But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only said, in a low voice, "I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near us, do not speak, do not move!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en974"> "Hark!"</span><span id="en975"> he exclaimed.</span><span id="en976"> "Whose voice was that?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en977"> His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white hair, which they tore in a frenzy.</span><span id="en978"> It died out, as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and gloomily shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span id="en979"> "No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming.</span><span id="en980"> It can't be.</span><span id="en981"> See what the prisoner is.</span><span id="en982"> These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard.</span><span id="en983"> No, no.</span><span id="en984"> She was—and He was—before the slow years of the North Tower—ages ago.</span><span id="en985"> What is your name, my gentle angel?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en986"> Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.</span></p>
<p><span id="en987"> "O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history.</span><span id="en988"> But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here.</span><span id="en989"> All that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me.</span><span id="en990"> Kiss me, kiss me!</span><span id="en991"> O my dear, my dear!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en992"> His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en993"> "If you hear in my voice—I don't know that it is so, but I hope it is—if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it!</span><span id="en994"> If you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it!</span><span id="en995"> If, when I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en996"> She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a child.</span></p>
<p><span id="en997"> "If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it!</span><span id="en998"> And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it!</span><span id="en999"> Weep for her, then, and for me!</span><span id="en1000"> Good gentlemen, thank God!</span><span id="en1001"> I feel his sacred tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart.</span><span id="en1002"> O, see!</span><span id="en1003"> Thank God for us, thank God!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1004"> He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1005"> When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms—emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last—they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground.</span><span id="en1006"> He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out.</span><span id="en1007"> She had nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1008"> "If, without disturbing him," she said, raising her hand to Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1009"> "But, consider.</span><span id="en1010"> Is he fit for the journey?"</span><span id="en1011"> asked Mr.</span><span id="en1012"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1013"> "More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1014"> "It is true," said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear.</span><span id="en1015"> "More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.</span><span id="en1016"> Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1017"> "That's business," said Mr.</span><span id="en1018"> Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners; "and if business is to be done, I had better do it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1019"> "Then be so kind," urged Miss Manette, "as to leave us here.</span><span id="en1020"> You see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now.</span><span id="en1021"> Why should you be?</span><span id="en1022"> If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back, as quiet as you leave him.</span><span id="en1023"> In any case, I will take care of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1024"> Both Mr.</span><span id="en1025"> Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining.</span><span id="en1026"> But, as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away to do it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1027"> Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him.</span><span id="en1028"> The darkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1029"> Mr.</span><span id="en1030"> Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee.</span><span id="en1031"> Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr.</span><span id="en1032"> Lorry roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1033"> No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in the scared blank wonder of his face.</span><span id="en1034"> Whether he knew what had happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved.</span><span id="en1035"> They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more.</span><span id="en1036"> He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1037"> In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear.</span><span id="en1038"> He readily responded to his daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took—and kept—her hand in both his own.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1039"> They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.</span><span id="en1040"> Lorry closing the little procession.</span><span id="en1041"> They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and round at the walls.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1042"> "You remember the place, my father?</span><span id="en1043"> You remember coming up here?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1044"> "What did you say?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1045"> But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1046"> "Remember?</span><span id="en1047"> No, I don't remember.</span><span id="en1048"> It was so very long ago."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1049"> That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house, was apparent to them.</span><span id="en1050"> They heard him mutter, "One Hundred and Five, North Tower;" and when he looked about him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him.</span><span id="en1051"> On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1052"> No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street.</span><span id="en1053"> An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there.</span><span id="en1054"> Only one soul was to be seen, and that was Madame Defarge—who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1055"> The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed him, when Mr.</span><span id="en1056"> Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes.</span><span id="en1057"> Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard.</span><span id="en1058"> She quickly brought them down and handed them in;—and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1059"> Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word "To the Barrier!"</span><span id="en1060"> The postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1061"> Under the over-swinging lamps—swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse—and by lighted shops, gay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city gates.</span><span id="en1062"> Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there.</span><span id="en1063"> "Your papers, travellers!"</span><span id="en1064"> "See here then, Monsieur the Officer," said Defarge, getting down, and taking him gravely apart, "these are the papers of monsieur inside, with the white head.</span><span id="en1065"> They were consigned to me, with him, at the—" He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head.</span><span id="en1066"> "It is well.</span><span id="en1067"> Forward!"</span><span id="en1068"> from the uniform.</span><span id="en1069"> "Adieu!"</span><span id="en1070"> from Defarge.</span><span id="en1071"> And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great grove of stars.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1072"> Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.</span><span id="en1073"> All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more whispered in the ears of Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1074"> "I hope you care to be recalled to life?"</span></p>

<p><span id="en1075"> "I can't say."</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-2_htm_html_pgepubid00010">I. Five Years Later</h2>
<p><span id="en1077"> Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty.</span><span id="en1078"> It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious.</span><span id="en1079"> It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness.</span><span id="en1080"> They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable.</span><span id="en1081"> This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business.</span><span id="en1082"> Tellson's (they said) wanted no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment.</span><span id="en1083"> Noakes and Co.</span><span id="en1084"> 's might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank Heaven—!</span></p>
<p><span id="en1085"> Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's.</span><span id="en1086"> In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1087"> Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience.</span><span id="en1088"> After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar.</span><span id="en1089"> If your business necessitated your seeing "the House," you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight.</span><span id="en1090"> Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut.</span><span id="en1091"> Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again.</span><span id="en1092"> Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two.</span><span id="en1093"> Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air.</span><span id="en1094"> Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1095"> But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's.</span><span id="en1096"> Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's?</span><span id="en1097"> Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death.</span><span id="en1098"> Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention—it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse—but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after.</span><span id="en1099"> Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1100"> Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely.</span><span id="en1101"> When they took a young man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old.</span><span id="en1102"> They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him.</span><span id="en1103"> Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1104"> Outside Tellson's—never by any means in it, unless called in—was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house.</span><span id="en1105"> He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image.</span><span id="en1106"> People understood that Tellson's, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man.</span><span id="en1107"> The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post.</span><span id="en1108"> His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added appellation of Jerry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1109"> The scene was Mr.</span><span id="en1110"> Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty.</span><span id="en1111"> (Mr.</span><span id="en1112"> Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1113"> Mr.</span><span id="en1114"> Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one.</span><span id="en1115"> But they were very decently kept.</span><span id="en1116"> Early as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1117"> Mr.</span><span id="en1118"> Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin at home.</span><span id="en1119"> At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1120"> "Bust me, if she ain't at it agin!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1121"> A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1122"> "What!"</span><span id="en1123"> said Mr.</span><span id="en1124"> Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot.</span><span id="en1125"> "You're at it agin, are you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1126"> After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at the woman as a third.</span><span id="en1127"> It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr.</span><span id="en1128"> Cruncher's domestic economy, that, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1129"> "What," said Mr.</span><span id="en1130"> Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his mark—"what are you up to, Aggerawayter?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1131"> "I was only saying my prayers."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1132"> "Saying your prayers!</span><span id="en1133"> You're a nice woman!</span><span id="en1134"> What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1135"> "I was not praying against you; I was praying for you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1136"> "You weren't.</span><span id="en1137"> And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with.</span><span id="en1138"> Here!</span><span id="en1139"> your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your father's prosperity.</span><span id="en1140"> You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.</span><span id="en1141"> You've got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1142"> Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1143"> "And what do you suppose, you conceited female," said Mr.</span><span id="en1144"> Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, "that the worth of your prayers may be?</span><span id="en1145"> Name the price that you put your prayers at!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1146"> "They only come from the heart, Jerry.</span><span id="en1147"> They are worth no more than that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1148"> "Worth no more than that," repeated Mr.</span><span id="en1149"> Cruncher.</span><span id="en1150"> "They ain't worth much, then.</span><span id="en1151"> Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you.</span><span id="en1152"> I can't afford it.</span><span id="en1153"> I'm not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking.</span><span id="en1154"> If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and child, and not in opposition to 'em.</span><span id="en1155"> If I had had any but a unnat'ral wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.</span><span id="en1156"> B-u-u-ust me!"</span><span id="en1157"> said Mr.</span><span id="en1158"> Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his clothes, "if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with!</span><span id="en1159"> Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call.</span><span id="en1160"> For, I tell you," here he addressed his wife once more, "I won't be gone agin, in this manner.</span><span id="en1161"> I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say now!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1162"> Growling, in addition, such phrases as "Ah!</span><span id="en1163"> yes!</span><span id="en1164"> You're religious, too.</span><span id="en1165"> You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you?</span><span id="en1166"> Not you!"</span><span id="en1167"> and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr.</span><span id="en1168"> Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.</span><span id="en1169"> In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father's did, kept the required watch upon his mother.</span><span id="en1170"> He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of "You are going to flop, mother.</span><span id="en1171"> —Halloa, father!"</span><span id="en1172"> and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1173"> Mr.</span><span id="en1174"> Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast.</span><span id="en1175"> He resented Mrs.</span><span id="en1176"> Cruncher's saying grace with particular animosity.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1177"> "Now, Aggerawayter!</span><span id="en1178"> What are you up to?</span><span id="en1179"> At it again?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1180"> His wife explained that she had merely "asked a blessing."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1181"> "Don't do it!"</span><span id="en1182"> said Mr.</span><span id="en1183"> Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions.</span><span id="en1184"> "I ain't a going to be blest out of house and home.</span><span id="en1185"> I won't have my wittles blest off my table.</span><span id="en1186"> Keep still!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1187"> Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie.</span><span id="en1188"> Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1189"> It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description of himself as "a honest tradesman."</span><span id="en1190"> His stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young Jerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's feet, it formed the encampment for the day.</span><span id="en1191"> On this post of his, Mr.</span><span id="en1192"> Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,—and was almost as in-looking.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1193"> Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's, Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose.</span><span id="en1194"> Father and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.</span><span id="en1195"> The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street.</span></p>

<p><span id="en1196"> "Porter wanted!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1197"> "Hooray, father!</span><span id="en1198"> Here's an early job to begin with!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1199"> Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing, and cogitated.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1200"> "Al-ways rusty!</span><span id="en1201"> His fingers is al-ways rusty!"</span><span id="en1202"> muttered young Jerry.</span><span id="en1203"> "Where does my father get all that iron rust from?</span><span id="en1204"> He don't get no iron rust here!"</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-2_htm_html_pgepubid00011">II. A Sight</h2>
<p><span id="en1205"> "You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?"</span><span id="en1206"> said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1207"> "Ye-es, sir," returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner.</span><span id="en1208"> "I do know the Bailey."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1209"> "Just so.</span><span id="en1210"> And you know Mr.</span><span id="en1211"> Lorry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1212"> "I know Mr.</span><span id="en1213"> Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey.</span><span id="en1214"> Much better," said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question, "than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1215"> "Very well.</span><span id="en1216"> Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the door-keeper this note for Mr.</span><span id="en1217"> Lorry.</span><span id="en1218"> He will then let you in."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1219"> "Into the court, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1220"> "Into the court."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1221"> Mr.</span><span id="en1222"> Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to interchange the inquiry, "What do you think of this?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1223"> "Am I to wait in the court, sir?"</span><span id="en1224"> he asked, as the result of that conference.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1225"> "I am going to tell you.</span><span id="en1226"> The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.</span><span id="en1227"> Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr.</span><span id="en1228"> Lorry's attention, and show him where you stand.</span><span id="en1229"> Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he wants you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1230"> "Is that all, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1231"> "That's all.</span><span id="en1232"> He wishes to have a messenger at hand.</span><span id="en1233"> This is to tell him you are there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1234"> As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1235"> "I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1236"> "Treason!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1237"> "That's quartering," said Jerry.</span><span id="en1238"> "Barbarous!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1239"> "It is the law," remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised spectacles upon him.</span><span id="en1240"> "It is the law."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1241"> "It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think.</span><span id="en1242"> It's hard enough to kill him, but it's wery hard to spile him, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1243"> "Not at all," retained the ancient clerk.</span><span id="en1244"> "Speak well of the law.</span><span id="en1245"> Take care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take care of itself.</span><span id="en1246"> I give you that advice."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1247"> "It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice," said Jerry.</span><span id="en1248"> "I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1249"> "Well, well," said the old clerk; "we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood.</span><span id="en1250"> Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry ways.</span><span id="en1251"> Here is the letter.</span><span id="en1252"> Go along."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1253"> Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of, "You are a lean old one, too," made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination, and went his way.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1254"> They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.</span><span id="en1255"> But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench.</span><span id="en1256"> It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him.</span><span id="en1257"> For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.</span><span id="en1258"> So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning.</span><span id="en1259"> It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven.</span><span id="en1260"> Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that "Whatever is is right;" an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1261"> Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in his letter through a trap in it.</span><span id="en1262"> For, people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam—only the former entertainment was much the dearer.</span><span id="en1263"> Therefore, all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded—except, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1264"> After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr.</span><span id="en1265"> Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1266"> "What's on?"</span><span id="en1267"> he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next to.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1268"> "Nothing yet."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1269"> "What's coming on?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1270"> "The Treason case."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1271"> "The quartering one, eh?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1272"> "Ah!"</span><span id="en1273"> returned the man, with a relish; "he'll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged, and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on, and then his head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters.</span><span id="en1274"> That's the sentence."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1275"> "If he's found Guilty, you mean to say?"</span><span id="en1276"> Jerry added, by way of proviso.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1277"> "Oh!</span><span id="en1278"> they'll find him guilty," said the other.</span><span id="en1279"> "Don't you be afraid of that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1280"> Mr.</span><span id="en1281"> Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he saw making his way to Mr.</span><span id="en1282"> Lorry, with the note in his hand.</span><span id="en1283"> Mr.</span><span id="en1284"> Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr.</span><span id="en1285"> Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court.</span><span id="en1286"> After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr.</span><span id="en1287"> Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1288"> "What's he got to do with the case?"</span><span id="en1289"> asked the man he had spoken with.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1290"> "Blest if I know," said Jerry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1291"> "What have you got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1292"> "Blest if I know that either," said Jerry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1293"> The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue.</span><span id="en1294"> Presently, the dock became the central point of interest.</span><span id="en1295"> Two gaolers, who had been standing there, went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1296"> Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him.</span><span id="en1297"> All the human breath in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire.</span><span id="en1298"> Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him—stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.</span><span id="en1299"> Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1300"> The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye.</span><span id="en1301"> His condition was that of a young gentleman.</span><span id="en1302"> He was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament.</span><span id="en1303"> As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun.</span><span id="en1304"> He was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1305"> The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity.</span><span id="en1306"> Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence—had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared—by just so much would he have lost in his fascination.</span><span id="en1307"> The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation.</span><span id="en1308"> Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1309"> Silence in the court!</span><span id="en1310"> Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to send to Canada and North America.</span><span id="en1311"> This much, Jerry, with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and that Mr.</span><span id="en1312"> Attorney-General was making ready to speak.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1313"> The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it.</span><span id="en1314"> He was quiet and attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn.</span><span id="en1315"> The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1316"> Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down upon him.</span><span id="en1317"> Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together.</span><span id="en1318"> Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead.</span><span id="en1319"> Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind.</span><span id="en1320"> Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1321"> It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left.</span><span id="en1322"> About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1323"> The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing.</span><span id="en1324"> When this expression was upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up—as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter—he became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1325"> His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by him, and the other pressed upon it.</span><span id="en1326"> She had drawn close to him, in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner.</span><span id="en1327"> Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused.</span><span id="en1328"> This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, "Who are they?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1329"> Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1330"> "Witnesses."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1331"> "For which side?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1332"> "Against."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1333"> "Against what side?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1334"> "The prisoner's."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1335"> The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr.</span><span id="en1336"> Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.</span></p>

<p><span id="en1337"> Mr.</span><span id="en1338"> Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life.</span><span id="en1339"> That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before.</span><span id="en1340"> That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account.</span><span id="en1341"> That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.</span><span id="en1342"> That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.</span><span id="en1343"> That, this patriot would be produced before them.</span><span id="en1344"> That, his position and attitude were, on the whole, sublime.</span><span id="en1345"> That, he had been the prisoner's friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country.</span><span id="en1346"> That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one.</span><span id="en1347"> That, as they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one.</span><span id="en1348"> That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.</span><span id="en1349"> That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master's table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers.</span><span id="en1350"> That, he (Mr.</span><span id="en1351"> Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr.</span><span id="en1352"> Attorney-General's) brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.</span><span id="en1353"> Attorney-General's) father and mother.</span><span id="en1354"> That, he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise.</span><span id="en1355"> That, the evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power.</span><span id="en1356"> That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions.</span><span id="en1357"> That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.</span><span id="en1358"> That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as they knew they were), must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether they liked it or not.</span><span id="en1359"> That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off.</span><span id="en1360"> That head Mr.</span><span id="en1361"> Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1362"> When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become.</span><span id="en1363"> When toned down again, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1364"> Mr.</span><span id="en1365"> Solicitor-General then, following his leader's lead, examined the patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name.</span><span id="en1366"> The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr.</span><span id="en1367"> Attorney-General had described it to be—perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly.</span><span id="en1368"> Having released his noble bosom of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.</span><span id="en1369"> Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions.</span><span id="en1370"> The wigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1371"> Had he ever been a spy himself?</span><span id="en1372"> No, he scorned the base insinuation.</span><span id="en1373"> What did he live upon?</span><span id="en1374"> His property.</span><span id="en1375"> Where was his property?</span><span id="en1376"> He didn't precisely remember where it was.</span><span id="en1377"> What was it?</span><span id="en1378"> No business of anybody's.</span><span id="en1379"> Had he inherited it?</span><span id="en1380"> Yes, he had.</span><span id="en1381"> From whom?</span><span id="en1382"> Distant relation.</span><span id="en1383"> Very distant?</span><span id="en1384"> Rather.</span><span id="en1385"> Ever been in prison?</span><span id="en1386"> Certainly not.</span><span id="en1387"> Never in a debtors' prison?</span><span id="en1388"> Didn't see what that had to do with it.</span><span id="en1389"> Never in a debtors' prison?</span><span id="en1390"> —Come, once again.</span><span id="en1391"> Never?</span><span id="en1392"> Yes.</span><span id="en1393"> How many times?</span><span id="en1394"> Two or three times.</span><span id="en1395"> Not five or six?</span><span id="en1396"> Perhaps.</span><span id="en1397"> Of what profession?</span><span id="en1398"> Gentleman.</span><span id="en1399"> Ever been kicked?</span><span id="en1400"> Might have been.</span><span id="en1401"> Frequently?</span><span id="en1402"> No.</span><span id="en1403"> Ever kicked downstairs?</span><span id="en1404"> Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord.</span><span id="en1405"> Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?</span><span id="en1406"> Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true.</span><span id="en1407"> Swear it was not true?</span><span id="en1408"> Positively.</span><span id="en1409"> Ever live by cheating at play?</span><span id="en1410"> Never.</span><span id="en1411"> Ever live by play?</span><span id="en1412"> Not more than other gentlemen do.</span><span id="en1413"> Ever borrow money of the prisoner?</span><span id="en1414"> Yes.</span><span id="en1415"> Ever pay him?</span><span id="en1416"> No.</span><span id="en1417"> Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?</span><span id="en1418"> No.</span><span id="en1419"> Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists?</span><span id="en1420"> Certain.</span><span id="en1421"> Knew no more about the lists?</span><span id="en1422"> No.</span><span id="en1423"> Had not procured them himself, for instance?</span><span id="en1424"> No.</span><span id="en1425"> Expect to get anything by this evidence?</span><span id="en1426"> No.</span><span id="en1427"> Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?</span><span id="en1428"> Oh dear no.</span><span id="en1429"> Or to do anything?</span><span id="en1430"> Oh dear no.</span><span id="en1431"> Swear that?</span><span id="en1432"> Over and over again.</span><span id="en1433"> No motives but motives of sheer patriotism?</span><span id="en1434"> None whatever.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1435"> The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a great rate.</span><span id="en1436"> He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and simplicity, four years ago.</span><span id="en1437"> He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.</span><span id="en1438"> He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity—never thought of such a thing.</span><span id="en1439"> He began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards.</span><span id="en1440"> In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner's pockets, over and over again.</span><span id="en1441"> He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner's desk.</span><span id="en1442"> He had not put them there first.</span><span id="en1443"> He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne.</span><span id="en1444"> He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given information.</span><span id="en1445"> He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one.</span><span id="en1446"> He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence.</span><span id="en1447"> He didn't call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious.</span><span id="en1448"> Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too.</span><span id="en1449"> He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1450"> The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr.</span><span id="en1451"> Attorney-General called Mr.</span><span id="en1452"> Jarvis Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1453"> "Mr.</span><span id="en1454"> Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1455"> "I am."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1456"> "On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1457"> "It did."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1458"> "Were there any other passengers in the mail?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1459"> "Two."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1460"> "Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1461"> "They did."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1462"> "Mr.</span><span id="en1463"> Lorry, look upon the prisoner.</span><span id="en1464"> Was he one of those two passengers?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1465"> "I cannot undertake to say that he was."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1466"> "Does he resemble either of these two passengers?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1467"> "Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1468"> "Mr.</span><span id="en1469"> Lorry, look again upon the prisoner.</span><span id="en1470"> Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1471"> "No."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1472"> "You will not swear, Mr.</span><span id="en1473"> Lorry, that he was not one of them?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1474"> "No."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1475"> "So at least you say he may have been one of them?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1476"> "Yes.</span><span id="en1477"> Except that I remember them both to have been—like myself—timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous air."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1478"> "Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr.</span><span id="en1479"> Lorry?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1480"> "I certainly have seen that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1481"> "Mr.</span><span id="en1482"> Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner.</span><span id="en1483"> Have you seen him, to your certain knowledge, before?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1484"> "I have."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1485"> "When?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1486"> "I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the voyage with me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1487"> "At what hour did he come on board?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1488"> "At a little after midnight."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1489"> "In the dead of the night.</span><span id="en1490"> Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1491"> "He happened to be the only one."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1492"> "Never mind about 'happening,' Mr.</span><span id="en1493"> Lorry.</span><span id="en1494"> He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1495"> "He was."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1496"> "Were you travelling alone, Mr.</span><span id="en1497"> Lorry, or with any companion?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1498"> "With two companions.</span><span id="en1499"> A gentleman and lady.</span><span id="en1500"> They are here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1501"> "They are here.</span><span id="en1502"> Had you any conversation with the prisoner?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1503"> "Hardly any.</span><span id="en1504"> The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1505"> "Miss Manette!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1506"> The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now turned again, stood up where she had sat.</span><span id="en1507"> Her father rose with her, and kept her hand drawn through his arm.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1508"> "Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1509"> To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.</span><span id="en1510"> Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him to remain quite still.</span><span id="en1511"> His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart.</span><span id="en1512"> The buzz of the great flies was loud again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1513"> "Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1514"> "Yes, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1515"> "Where?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1516"> "On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same occasion."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1517"> "You are the young lady just now referred to?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1518"> "O!</span><span id="en1519"> most unhappily, I am!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1520"> The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: "Answer the questions put to you, and make no remark upon them."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1521"> "Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1522"> "Yes, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1523"> "Recall it."</span></p>

<p><span id="en1524"> "Do you mean the prisoner?"</span><span id="en1525"> inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1526"> "Yes, my Lord."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1527"> "Then say the prisoner."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1528"> "When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father," turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, "was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health.</span><span id="en1529"> My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him.</span><span id="en1530"> There were no other passengers that night, but we four.</span><span id="en1531"> The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done.</span><span id="en1532"> I had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour.</span><span id="en1533"> He did it for me.</span><span id="en1534"> He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father's state, and I am sure he felt it.</span><span id="en1535"> That was the manner of our beginning to speak together."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1536"> "Let me interrupt you for a moment.</span><span id="en1537"> Had he come on board alone?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1538"> "No."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1539"> "How many were with him?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1540"> "Two French gentlemen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1541"> "Had they conferred together?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1542"> "They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1543"> "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1544"> "Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don't know what papers."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1545"> "Like these in shape and size?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1546"> "Possibly, but indeed I don't know, although they stood whispering very near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that they looked at papers."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1547"> "Now, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1548"> "The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me—which arose out of my helpless situation—as he was kind, and good, and useful to my father.</span><span id="en1549"> I hope," bursting into tears, "I may not repay him by doing him harm to-day."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1550"> Buzzing from the blue-flies.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1551"> "Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give—which you must give—and which you cannot escape from giving—with great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition.</span><span id="en1552"> Please to go on."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1553"> "He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name.</span><span id="en1554"> He said that this business had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals, take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1555"> "Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette?</span><span id="en1556"> Be particular."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1557"> "He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on England's part.</span><span id="en1558"> He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third.</span><span id="en1559"> But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said laughingly, and to beguile the time."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1560"> Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators.</span><span id="en1561"> Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon the counsel for and against.</span><span id="en1562"> Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1563"> Mr.</span><span id="en1564"> Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's father, Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en1565"> Who was called accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1566"> "Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner.</span><span id="en1567"> Have you ever seen him before?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1568"> "Once.</span><span id="en1569"> When he called at my lodgings in London.</span><span id="en1570"> Some three years, or three years and a half ago."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1571"> "Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1572"> "Sir, I can do neither."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1573"> "Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1574"> He answered, in a low voice, "There is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1575"> "Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1576"> He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, "A long imprisonment."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1577"> "Were you newly released on the occasion in question?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1578"> "They tell me so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1579"> "Have you no remembrance of the occasion?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1580"> "None.</span><span id="en1581"> My mind is a blank, from some time—I cannot even say what time—when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here.</span><span id="en1582"> She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar.</span><span id="en1583"> I have no remembrance of the process."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1584"> Mr.</span><span id="en1585"> Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down together.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1586"> A singular circumstance then arose in the case.</span><span id="en1587"> The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person.</span><span id="en1588"> The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him.</span><span id="en1589"> Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1590"> "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1591"> The witness was quite sure.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1592"> "Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1593"> Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1594"> "Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there," pointing to him who had tossed the paper over, "and then look well upon the prisoner.</span><span id="en1595"> How say you?</span><span id="en1596"> Are they very like each other?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1597"> Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought into comparison.</span><span id="en1598"> My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable.</span><span id="en1599"> My Lord inquired of Mr.</span><span id="en1600"> Stryver (the prisoner's counsel), whether they were next to try Mr.</span><span id="en1601"> Carton (name of my learned friend) for treason?</span><span id="en1602"> But, Mr.</span><span id="en1603"> Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it; and more.</span><span id="en1604"> The upshot of which, was, to smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1605"> Mr.</span><span id="en1606"> Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence.</span><span id="en1607"> He had now to attend while Mr.</span><span id="en1608"> Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas—which he certainly did look rather like.</span><span id="en1609"> How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making those passages across the Channel—though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose.</span><span id="en1610"> How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together;—with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.</span><span id="en1611"> How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears, and therefore Mr.</span><span id="en1612"> Attorney-General had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State Trials of this country were full.</span><span id="en1613"> But, there my Lord interposed (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1614"> Mr.</span><span id="en1615"> Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr.</span><span id="en1616"> Cruncher had next to attend while Mr.</span><span id="en1617"> Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.</span><span id="en1618"> Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse.</span><span id="en1619"> Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1620"> And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1621"> Mr.</span><span id="en1622"> Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.</span><span id="en1623"> While his learned friend, Mr.</span><span id="en1624"> Stryver, massing his papers before him, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day.</span><span id="en1625"> Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike.</span><span id="en1626"> Mr.</span><span id="en1627"> Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, "I'd hold half a guinea that he don't get no law-work to do.</span><span id="en1628"> Don't look like the sort of one to get any, do he?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1629"> Yet, this Mr.</span><span id="en1630"> Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon her father's breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: "Officer!</span><span id="en1631"> look to that young lady.</span><span id="en1632"> Help the gentleman to take her out.</span><span id="en1633"> Don't you see she will fall!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1634"> There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father.</span><span id="en1635"> It had evidently been a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled.</span><span id="en1636"> He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud, ever since.</span><span id="en1637"> As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1638"> They were not agreed, and wished to retire.</span><span id="en1639"> My Lord (perhaps with George Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and retired himself.</span><span id="en1640"> The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in the court were now being lighted.</span><span id="en1641"> It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while.</span><span id="en1642"> The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1643"> Mr.</span><span id="en1644"> Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1645"> "Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can.</span><span id="en1646"> But, keep in the way.</span><span id="en1647"> You will be sure to hear when the jury come in.</span><span id="en1648"> Don't be a moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank.</span><span id="en1649"> You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long before I can."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1650"> Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling.</span><span id="en1651"> Mr.</span><span id="en1652"> Carton came up at the moment, and touched Mr.</span><span id="en1653"> Lorry on the arm.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1654"> "How is the young lady?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1655"> "She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she feels the better for being out of court."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1656"> "I'll tell the prisoner so.</span><span id="en1657"> It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1658"> Mr.</span><span id="en1659"> Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind, and Mr.</span><span id="en1660"> Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.</span><span id="en1661"> The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all eyes, ears, and spikes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1662"> "Mr.</span><span id="en1663"> Darnay!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1664"> The prisoner came forward directly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1665"> "You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette.</span><span id="en1666"> She will do very well.</span><span id="en1667"> You have seen the worst of her agitation."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1668"> "I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it.</span><span id="en1669"> Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1670"> "Yes, I could.</span><span id="en1671"> I will, if you ask it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1672"> Mr.</span><span id="en1673"> Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent.</span><span id="en1674"> He stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1675"> "I do ask it.</span><span id="en1676"> Accept my cordial thanks."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1677"> "What," said Carton, still only half turned towards him, "do you expect, Mr.</span><span id="en1678"> Darnay?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1679"> "The worst."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1680"> "It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest.</span><span id="en1681"> But I think their withdrawing is in your favour."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1682"> Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no more: but left them—so like each other in feature, so unlike each other in manner—standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1683"> An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.</span><span id="en1684"> The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along with them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1685"> "Jerry!</span><span id="en1686"> Jerry!"</span><span id="en1687"> Mr.</span><span id="en1688"> Lorry was already calling at the door when he got there.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1689"> "Here, sir!</span><span id="en1690"> It's a fight to get back again.</span><span id="en1691"> Here I am, sir!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1692"> Mr.</span><span id="en1693"> Lorry handed him a paper through the throng.</span><span id="en1694"> "Quick!</span><span id="en1695"> Have you got it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1696"> "Yes, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1697"> Hastily written on the paper was the word "ACQUITTED."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1698"> "If you had sent the message, 'Recalled to Life,' again," muttered Jerry, as he turned, "I should have known what you meant, this time."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1699"> He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else, until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-3_htm_html_pgepubid00013">IV. Congratulatory</h2>
<p><span id="en1700"> From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr.</span><span id="en1701"> Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, Mr.</span><span id="en1702"> Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.</span><span id="en1703"> Charles Darnay—just released—congratulating him on his escape from death.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1704"> It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris.</span><span id="en1705"> Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason.</span><span id="en1706"> While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always—as on the trial—evoke this condition from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1707"> Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind.</span><span id="en1708"> She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always.</span><span id="en1709"> Not absolutely always, for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed them over.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1710"> Mr.</span><span id="en1711"> Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to Mr.</span><span id="en1712"> Stryver, whom he warmly thanked.</span><span id="en1713"> Mr.</span><span id="en1714"> Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1715"> He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr.</span><span id="en1716"> Lorry clean out of the group: "I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.</span><span id="en1717"> Darnay.</span><span id="en1718"> It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1719"> "You have laid me under an obligation to you for life—in two senses," said his late client, taking his hand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1720"> "I have done my best for you, Mr.</span><span id="en1721"> Darnay; and my best is as good as another man's, I believe."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1722"> It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, "Much better," Mr.</span><span id="en1723"> Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1724"> "You think so?"</span><span id="en1725"> said Mr.</span><span id="en1726"> Stryver.</span><span id="en1727"> "Well!</span><span id="en1728"> you have been present all day, and you ought to know.</span><span id="en1729"> You are a man of business, too."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1730"> "And as such," quoth Mr.</span><span id="en1731"> Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it—"as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes.</span><span id="en1732"> Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.</span><span id="en1733"> Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1734"> "Speak for yourself, Mr.</span><span id="en1735"> Lorry," said Stryver; "I have a night's work to do yet.</span><span id="en1736"> Speak for yourself."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1737"> "I speak for myself," answered Mr.</span><span id="en1738"> Lorry, "and for Mr.</span><span id="en1739"> Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and—Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?"</span><span id="en1740"> He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1741"> His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear.</span><span id="en1742"> With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1743"> "My father," said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1744"> He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1745"> "Shall we go home, my father?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1746"> With a long breath, he answered "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1747"> The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression—which he himself had originated—that he would not be released that night.</span><span id="en1748"> The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.</span><span id="en1749"> Walking between her father and Mr.</span><span id="en1750"> Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air.</span><span id="en1751"> A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1752"> Mr.</span><span id="en1753"> Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room.</span><span id="en1754"> Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away.</span><span id="en1755"> He now stepped up to where Mr.</span><span id="en1756"> Lorry and Mr.</span><span id="en1757"> Darnay stood upon the pavement.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1758"> "So, Mr.</span><span id="en1759"> Lorry!</span><span id="en1760"> Men of business may speak to Mr.</span><span id="en1761"> Darnay now?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1762"> Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr.</span><span id="en1763"> Carton's part in the day's proceedings; nobody had known of it.</span><span id="en1764"> He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1765"> "If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr.</span><span id="en1766"> Darnay."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1767"> Mr.</span><span id="en1768"> Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, "You have mentioned that before, sir.</span><span id="en1769"> We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters.</span><span id="en1770"> We have to think of the House more than ourselves."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1771"> "I know, I know," rejoined Mr.</span><span id="en1772"> Carton, carelessly.</span><span id="en1773"> "Don't be nettled, Mr.</span><span id="en1774"> Lorry.</span><span id="en1775"> You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare say."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1776"> "And indeed, sir," pursued Mr.</span><span id="en1777"> Lorry, not minding him, "I really don't know what you have to do with the matter.</span><span id="en1778"> If you'll excuse me, as very much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your business."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1779"> "Business!</span><span id="en1780"> Bless you, I have no business," said Mr.</span><span id="en1781"> Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1782"> "It is a pity you have not, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1783"> "I think so, too."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1784"> "If you had," pursued Mr.</span><span id="en1785"> Lorry, "perhaps you would attend to it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1786"> "Lord love you, no!</span><span id="en1787"> —I shouldn't," said Mr.</span><span id="en1788"> Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1789"> "Well, sir!"</span><span id="en1790"> cried Mr.</span><span id="en1791"> Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference, "business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing.</span><span id="en1792"> And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.</span><span id="en1793"> Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance.</span><span id="en1794"> Mr.</span><span id="en1795"> Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!</span><span id="en1796"> I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.</span><span id="en1797"> —Chair there!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1798"> Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.</span><span id="en1799"> Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1800"> "This is a strange chance that throws you and me together.</span><span id="en1801"> This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1802"> "I hardly seem yet," returned Charles Darnay, "to belong to this world again."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1803"> "I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another.</span><span id="en1804"> You speak faintly."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1805"> "I begin to think I am faint."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1806"> "Then why the devil don't you dine?</span><span id="en1807"> I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to—this, or some other.</span><span id="en1808"> Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1809"> Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern.</span><span id="en1810"> Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1811"> "Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.</span><span id="en1812"> Darnay?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1813"> "I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1814"> "It must be an immense satisfaction!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1815"> He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large one.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1816"> "As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.</span><span id="en1817"> It has no good in it for me—except wine like this—nor I for it.</span><span id="en1818"> So we are not much alike in that particular.</span><span id="en1819"> Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and I."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1820"> Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1821"> "Now your dinner is done," Carton presently said, "why don't you call a health, Mr.</span><span id="en1822"> Darnay; why don't you give your toast?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1823"> "What health?</span><span id="en1824"> What toast?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1825"> "Why, it's on the tip of your tongue.</span><span id="en1826"> It ought to be, it must be, I'll swear it's there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1827"> "Miss Manette, then!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1828"> "Miss Manette, then!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1829"> Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1830"> "That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr.</span><span id="en1831"> Darnay!"</span><span id="en1832"> he said, filling his new goblet.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1833"> A slight frown and a laconic "Yes," were the answer.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1834"> "That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by!</span><span id="en1835"> How does it feel?</span><span id="en1836"> Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr.</span><span id="en1837"> Darnay?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1838"> Again Darnay answered not a word.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1839"> "She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her.</span><span id="en1840"> Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1841"> The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day.</span><span id="en1842"> He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1843"> "I neither want any thanks, nor merit any," was the careless rejoinder.</span><span id="en1844"> "It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second.</span><span id="en1845"> Mr.</span><span id="en1846"> Darnay, let me ask you a question."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1847"> "Willingly, and a small return for your good offices."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1848"> "Do you think I particularly like you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1849"> "Really, Mr.</span><span id="en1850"> Carton," returned the other, oddly disconcerted, "I have not asked myself the question."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1851"> "But ask yourself the question now."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1852"> "You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1853"> "I don't think I do," said Carton.</span><span id="en1854"> "I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1855"> "Nevertheless," pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, "there is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1856"> Carton rejoining, "Nothing in life!"</span><span id="en1857"> Darnay rang.</span><span id="en1858"> "Do you call the whole reckoning?"</span><span id="en1859"> said Carton.</span><span id="en1860"> On his answering in the affirmative, "Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1861"> The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.</span><span id="en1862"> Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, "A last word, Mr.</span><span id="en1863"> Darnay: you think I am drunk?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1864"> "I think you have been drinking, Mr.</span><span id="en1865"> Carton."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1866"> "Think?</span><span id="en1867"> You know I have been drinking."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1868"> "Since I must say so, I know it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1869"> "Then you shall likewise know why.</span><span id="en1870"> I am a disappointed drudge, sir.</span><span id="en1871"> I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1872"> "Much to be regretted.</span><span id="en1873"> You might have used your talents better."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1874"> "May be so, Mr.</span><span id="en1875"> Darnay; may be not.</span><span id="en1876"> Don't let your sober face elate you, however; you don't know what it may come to.</span><span id="en1877"> Good night!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1878"> When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1879"> "Do you particularly like the man?"</span><span id="en1880"> he muttered, at his own image; "why should you particularly like a man who resembles you?</span><span id="en1881"> There is nothing in you to like; you know that.</span><span id="en1882"> Ah, confound you!</span><span id="en1883"> What a change you have made in yourself!</span><span id="en1884"> A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been!</span><span id="en1885"> Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was?</span><span id="en1886"> Come on, and have it out in plain words!</span><span id="en1887"> You hate the fellow."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1888"> He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-3_htm_html_pgepubid00014">V. The Jackal</h2>
<p><span id="en1889"> Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard.</span><span id="en1890"> So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.</span><span id="en1891"> The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.</span><span id="en1892"> Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1893"> A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr.</span><span id="en1894"> Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted.</span><span id="en1895"> Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the florid countenance of Mr.</span><span id="en1896"> Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1897"> It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr.</span><span id="en1898"> Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments.</span><span id="en1899"> But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this.</span><span id="en1900"> The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1901"> Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great ally.</span><span id="en1902"> What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a king's ship.</span><span id="en1903"> Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat.</span><span id="en1904"> At last, it began to get about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1905"> "Ten o'clock, sir," said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to wake him—"ten o'clock, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1906"> "What's the matter?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1907"> "Ten o'clock, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1908"> "What do you mean?</span><span id="en1909"> Ten o'clock at night?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1910"> "Yes, sir.</span><span id="en1911"> Your honour told me to call you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1912"> "Oh!</span><span id="en1913"> I remember.</span><span id="en1914"> Very well, very well."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1915"> After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out.</span><span id="en1916"> He turned into the Temple, and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1917"> The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the Stryver principal opened the door.</span><span id="en1918"> He had his slippers on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease.</span><span id="en1919"> He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1920"> "You are a little late, Memory," said Stryver.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1921"> "About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1922"> They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers, where there was a blazing fire.</span><span id="en1923"> A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1924"> "You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1925"> "Two to-night, I think.</span><span id="en1926"> I have been dining with the day's client; or seeing him dine—it's all one!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1927"> "That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the identification.</span><span id="en1928"> How did you come by it?</span><span id="en1929"> When did it strike you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1930"> "I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1931"> Mr.</span><span id="en1932"> Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1933"> "You and your luck, Sydney!</span><span id="en1934"> Get to work, get to work."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1935"> Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel or two.</span><span id="en1936"> Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down at the table, and said, "Now I am ready!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1937"> "Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory," said Mr.</span><span id="en1938"> Stryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1939"> "How much?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1940"> "Only two sets of them."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1941"> "Give me the worst first."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1942"> "There they are, Sydney.</span><span id="en1943"> Fire away!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1944"> The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand.</span><span id="en1945"> Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass—which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips.</span><span id="en1946"> Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his towels anew.</span><span id="en1947"> From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1948"> At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him.</span><span id="en1949"> The lion took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both.</span><span id="en1950"> When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate.</span><span id="en1951"> The jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1952"> "And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch," said Mr.</span><span id="en1953"> Stryver.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1954"> The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1955"> "You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day.</span><span id="en1956"> Every question told."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1957"> "I always am sound; am I not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1958"> "I don't gainsay it.</span><span id="en1959"> What has roughened your temper?</span><span id="en1960"> Put some punch to it and smooth it again."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1961"> With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1962"> "The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School," said Stryver, nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, "the old seesaw Sydney.</span><span id="en1963"> Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1964"> "Ah!"</span><span id="en1965"> returned the other, sighing: "yes!</span><span id="en1966"> The same Sydney, with the same luck.</span><span id="en1967"> Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1968"> "And why not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1969"> "God knows.</span><span id="en1970"> It was my way, I suppose."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1971"> He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him, looking at the fire.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1972"> "Carton," said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air, as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, "your way is, and always was, a lame way.</span><span id="en1973"> You summon no energy and purpose.</span><span id="en1974"> Look at me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1975"> "Oh, botheration!"</span><span id="en1976"> returned Sydney, with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh, "don't you be moral!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1977"> "How have I done what I have done?"</span><span id="en1978"> said Stryver; "how do I do what I do?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1979"> "Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose.</span><span id="en1980"> But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do, you do.</span><span id="en1981"> You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1982"> "I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1983"> "I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were," said Carton.</span><span id="en1984"> At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1985"> "Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury," pursued Carton, "you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine.</span><span id="en1986"> Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always nowhere."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1987"> "And whose fault was that?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1988"> "Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours.</span><span id="en1989"> You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose.</span><span id="en1990"> It's a gloomy thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking.</span><span id="en1991"> Turn me in some other direction before I go."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1992"> "Well then!</span><span id="en1993"> Pledge me to the pretty witness," said Stryver, holding up his glass.</span><span id="en1994"> "Are you turned in a pleasant direction?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1995"> Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en1996"> "Pretty witness," he muttered, looking down into his glass.</span><span id="en1997"> "I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en1998"> "The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette."</span></p>
<p><span id="en1999"> "She pretty?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2000"> "Is she not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2001"> "No."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2002"> "Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2003"> "Rot the admiration of the whole Court!</span><span id="en2004"> Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty?</span><span id="en2005"> She was a golden-haired doll!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2006"> "Do you know, Sydney," said Mr.</span><span id="en2007"> Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: "do you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2008"> "Quick to see what happened!</span><span id="en2009"> If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.</span><span id="en2010"> I pledge you, but I deny the beauty.</span><span id="en2011"> And now I'll have no more drink; I'll get to bed."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2012"> When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows.</span><span id="en2013"> When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert.</span><span id="en2014"> And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2015"> Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance.</span><span id="en2016"> In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.</span><span id="en2017"> A moment, and it was gone.</span><span id="en2018"> Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2019"> Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-3_htm_html_pgepubid00015">VI. Hundreds of People</h2>
<p><span id="en2020"> The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square.</span><span id="en2021"> On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr.</span><span id="en2022"> Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor.</span><span id="en2023"> After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr.</span><span id="en2024"> Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2025"> On this certain fine Sunday, Mr.</span><span id="en2026"> Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit.</span><span id="en2027"> Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2028"> A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London.</span><span id="en2029"> There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it.</span><span id="en2030"> There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields.</span><span id="en2031"> As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2032"> The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness.</span><span id="en2033"> It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2034"> There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was.</span><span id="en2035"> The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night.</span><span id="en2036"> In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall—as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors.</span><span id="en2037"> Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen.</span><span id="en2038"> Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant.</span><span id="en2039"> These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2040"> Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.</span><span id="en2041"> His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2042"> These things were within Mr.</span><span id="en2043"> Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2044"> "Doctor Manette at home?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2045"> Expected home.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2046"> "Miss Lucie at home?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2047"> Expected home.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2048"> "Miss Pross at home?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2049"> Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2050"> "As I am at home myself," said Mr.</span><span id="en2051"> Lorry, "I'll go upstairs."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2052"> Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics.</span><span id="en2053"> Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful.</span><span id="en2054"> The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr.</span><span id="en2055"> Lorry stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved?</span></p>
<p><span id="en2056"> There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all, Mr.</span><span id="en2057"> Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him, walked from one to another.</span><span id="en2058"> The first was the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books, and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third, changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2059"> "I wonder," said Mr.</span><span id="en2060"> Lorry, pausing in his looking about, "that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2061"> "And why wonder at that?"</span><span id="en2062"> was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2063"> It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and had since improved.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2064"> "I should have thought—" Mr.</span><span id="en2065"> Lorry began.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2066"> "Pooh!</span><span id="en2067"> You'd have thought!"</span><span id="en2068"> said Miss Pross; and Mr.</span><span id="en2069"> Lorry left off.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2070"> "How do you do?"</span><span id="en2071"> inquired that lady then—sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2072"> "I am pretty well, I thank you," answered Mr.</span><span id="en2073"> Lorry, with meekness; "how are you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2074"> "Nothing to boast of," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2075"> "Indeed?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2076"> "Ah!</span><span id="en2077"> indeed!"</span><span id="en2078"> said Miss Pross.</span><span id="en2079"> "I am very much put out about my Ladybird."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2080"> "Indeed?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2081"> "For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll fidget me to death," said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from stature) was shortness.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2082"> "Really, then?"</span><span id="en2083"> said Mr.</span><span id="en2084"> Lorry, as an amendment.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2085"> "Really, is bad enough," returned Miss Pross, "but better.</span><span id="en2086"> Yes, I am very much put out."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2087"> "May I ask the cause?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2088"> "I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2089"> "Do dozens come for that purpose?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2090"> "Hundreds," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2091"> It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned, she exaggerated it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2092"> "Dear me!"</span><span id="en2093"> said Mr.</span><span id="en2094"> Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2095"> "I have lived with the darling—or the darling has lived with me, and paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing—since she was ten years old.</span><span id="en2096"> And it's really very hard," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2097"> Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr.</span><span id="en2098"> Lorry shook his head; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2099"> "All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2100"> "I began it, Miss Pross?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2101"> "Didn't you?</span><span id="en2102"> Who brought her father to life?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2103"> "Oh!</span><span id="en2104"> If that was beginning it—" said Mr.</span><span id="en2105"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2106"> "It wasn't ending it, I suppose?</span><span id="en2107"> I say, when you began it, it was hard enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances.</span><span id="en2108"> But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him), to take Ladybird's affections away from me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2109"> Mr.</span><span id="en2110"> Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those unselfish creatures—found only among women—who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives.</span><span id="en2111"> He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind—we all make such arrangements, more or less—he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2112"> "There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird," said Miss Pross; "and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a mistake in life."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2113"> Here again: Mr.</span><span id="en2114"> Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction.</span><span id="en2115"> Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr.</span><span id="en2116"> Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2117"> "As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business," he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, "let me ask you—does the Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2118"> "Never."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2119"> "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2120"> "Ah!"</span><span id="en2121"> returned Miss Pross, shaking her head.</span><span id="en2122"> "But I don't say he don't refer to it within himself."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2123"> "Do you believe that he thinks of it much?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2124"> "I do," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2125"> "Do you imagine—" Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2126"> "Never imagine anything.</span><span id="en2127"> Have no imagination at all."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2128"> "I stand corrected; do you suppose—you go so far as to suppose, sometimes?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2129"> "Now and then," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2130"> "Do you suppose," Mr.</span><span id="en2131"> Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, "that Doctor Manette has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2132"> "I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2133"> "And that is—?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2134"> "That she thinks he has."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2135"> "Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2136"> "Dull?"</span><span id="en2137"> Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2138"> Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr.</span><span id="en2139"> Lorry replied, "No, no, no.</span><span id="en2140"> Surely not.</span><span id="en2141"> To return to business:—Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is, should never touch upon that question?</span><span id="en2142"> I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him?</span><span id="en2143"> Believe me, Miss Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of zealous interest."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2144"> "Well!</span><span id="en2145"> To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell me," said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, "he is afraid of the whole subject."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2146"> "Afraid?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2147"> "It's plain enough, I should think, why he may be.</span><span id="en2148"> It's a dreadful remembrance.</span><span id="en2149"> Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it.</span><span id="en2150"> Not knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never feel certain of not losing himself again.</span><span id="en2151"> That alone wouldn't make the subject pleasant, I should think."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2152"> It was a profounder remark than Mr.</span><span id="en2153"> Lorry had looked for.</span><span id="en2154"> "True," said he, "and fearful to reflect upon.</span><span id="en2155"> Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him.</span><span id="en2156"> Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2157"> "Can't be helped," said Miss Pross, shaking her head.</span><span id="en2158"> "Touch that string, and he instantly changes for the worse.</span><span id="en2159"> Better leave it alone.</span><span id="en2160"> In short, must leave it alone, like or no like.</span><span id="en2161"> Sometimes, he gets up in the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up and down, walking up and down, in his room.</span><span id="en2162"> Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in his old prison.</span><span id="en2163"> She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed.</span><span id="en2164"> But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to him.</span><span id="en2165"> In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2166"> Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2167"> The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2168"> "Here they are!"</span><span id="en2169"> said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; "and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2170"> It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr.</span><span id="en2171"> Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never approach.</span><span id="en2172"> Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand.</span><span id="en2173"> However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2174"> Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women.</span><span id="en2175"> Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her—which last she only dared to do playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own chamber and cried.</span><span id="en2176"> The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible.</span><span id="en2177"> Mr.</span><span id="en2178"> Lorry was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home.</span><span id="en2179"> But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr.</span><span id="en2180"> Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2181"> Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people.</span><span id="en2182"> In the arrangements of the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and always acquitted herself marvellously.</span><span id="en2183"> Her dinners, of a very modest quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be better.</span><span id="en2184"> Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart culinary mysteries to her.</span><span id="en2185"> From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she pleased.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2186"> On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor—a blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance.</span><span id="en2187"> On this occasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2188"> It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit there in the air.</span><span id="en2189"> As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her, they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of Mr.</span><span id="en2190"> Lorry.</span><span id="en2191"> She had installed herself, some time before, as Mr.</span><span id="en2192"> Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished.</span><span id="en2193"> Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2194"> Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves.</span><span id="en2195"> Mr.</span><span id="en2196"> Darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he was only One.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2197"> Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie.</span><span id="en2198"> But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and retired into the house.</span><span id="en2199"> She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, "a fit of the jerks."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2200"> The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young.</span><span id="en2201"> The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2202"> He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity.</span><span id="en2203"> "Pray, Doctor Manette," said Mr.</span><span id="en2204"> Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree—and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London—"have you seen much of the Tower?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2205"> "Lucie and I have been there; but only casually.</span><span id="en2206"> We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2207"> "I have been there, as you remember," said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, "in another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it.</span><span id="en2208"> They told me a curious thing when I was there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2209"> "What was that?"</span><span id="en2210"> Lucie asked.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2211"> "In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten.</span><span id="en2212"> Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners—dates, names, complaints, and prayers.</span><span id="en2213"> Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters.</span><span id="en2214"> They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.</span><span id="en2215"> At first, they were read as D.</span><span id="en2216"> . C.</span><span id="en2217"> ; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G.</span><span id="en2218"> There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been.</span><span id="en2219"> At length, it was suggested that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG.</span><span id="en2220"> The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag.</span><span id="en2221"> What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2222"> "My father," exclaimed Lucie, "you are ill!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2223"> He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head.</span><span id="en2224"> His manner and his look quite terrified them all.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2225"> "No, my dear, not ill.</span><span id="en2226"> There are large drops of rain falling, and they made me start.</span><span id="en2227"> We had better go in."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2228"> He recovered himself almost instantly.</span><span id="en2229"> Rain was really falling in large drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it.</span><span id="en2230"> But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr.</span><span id="en2231"> Lorry either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2232"> He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr.</span><span id="en2233"> Lorry had doubts of his business eye.</span><span id="en2234"> The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and that the rain had startled him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2235"> Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon her, and yet no Hundreds of people.</span><span id="en2236"> Mr.</span><span id="en2237"> Carton had lounged in, but he made only Two.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2238"> The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and windows open, they were overpowered by heat.</span><span id="en2239"> When the tea-table was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the heavy twilight.</span><span id="en2240"> Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton leaned against a window.</span><span id="en2241"> The curtains were long and white, and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2242"> "The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few," said Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en2243"> "It comes slowly."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2244"> "It comes surely," said Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2245"> They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2246"> There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2247"> "A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!"</span><span id="en2248"> said Darnay, when they had listened for a while.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2249"> "Is it not impressive, Mr.</span><span id="en2250"> Darnay?"</span><span id="en2251"> asked Lucie.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2252"> "Let us shudder too.</span><span id="en2253"> We may know what it is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2254"> "It will seem nothing to you.</span><span id="en2255"> Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated.</span><span id="en2256"> I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2257"> "There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so," Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2258"> The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more rapid.</span><span id="en2259"> The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2260"> "Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or are we to divide them among us?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2261"> "I don't know, Mr.</span><span id="en2262"> Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it.</span><span id="en2263"> When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and my father's."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2264"> "I take them into mine!"</span><span id="en2265"> said Carton.</span><span id="en2266"> "I ask no questions and make no stipulations.</span><span id="en2267"> There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette, and I see them—by the Lightning."</span><span id="en2268"> He added the last words, after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2269"> "And I hear them!"</span><span id="en2270"> he added again, after a peal of thunder.</span><span id="en2271"> "Here they come, fast, fierce, and furious!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2272"> It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him, for no voice could be heard in it.</span><span id="en2273"> A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2274"> The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when Mr.</span><span id="en2275"> Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell.</span><span id="en2276"> There were solitary patches of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr.</span><span id="en2277"> Lorry, mindful of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2278"> "What a night it has been!</span><span id="en2279"> Almost a night, Jerry," said Mr.</span><span id="en2280"> Lorry, "to bring the dead out of their graves."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2281"> "I never see the night myself, master—nor yet I don't expect to—what would do that," answered Jerry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2282"> "Good night, Mr.</span><span id="en2283"> Carton," said the man of business.</span><span id="en2284"> "Good night, Mr.</span><span id="en2285"> Darnay.</span><span id="en2286"> Shall we ever see such a night again, together!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2287"> Perhaps.</span><span id="en2288"> Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar, bearing down upon them, too.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-4_htm_html_pgepubid00016">VII. Monseigneur in Town</h2>
<p><span id="en2289"> Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris.</span><span id="en2290"> Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without.</span><span id="en2291"> Monseigneur was about to take his chocolate.</span><span id="en2292"> Monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2293"> Yes.</span><span id="en2294"> It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips.</span><span id="en2295"> One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold watches), poured the chocolate out.</span><span id="en2296"> It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens.</span><span id="en2297"> Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2298"> Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented.</span><span id="en2299"> Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company.</span><span id="en2300"> So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France.</span><span id="en2301"> A happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured!</span><span id="en2302"> —always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2303"> Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way—tend to his own power and pocket.</span><span id="en2304"> Of his pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world was made for them.</span><span id="en2305"> The text of his order (altered from the original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: "The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2306"> Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General.</span><span id="en2307"> As to finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor.</span><span id="en2308"> Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General, poor in family.</span><span id="en2309"> Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind—always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2310"> A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General.</span><span id="en2311"> Thirty horses stood in his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women waited on his wife.</span><span id="en2312"> As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could, the Farmer-General—howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality—was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2313"> For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business—if that could have been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2314"> Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the score.</span><span id="en2315"> People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were no less abundant.</span><span id="en2316"> Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2317"> Projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2318"> Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2319"> Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time—and has been since—to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2320"> Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur—forming a goodly half of the polite company—would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother.</span><span id="en2321"> Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world—which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother—there was no such thing known to the fashion.</span><span id="en2322"> Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2323"> The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2324"> In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong.</span><span id="en2325"> As a promising way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the spot—thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future, for Monseigneur's guidance.</span><span id="en2326"> Besides these Dervishes, were other three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a jargon about "the Centre of Truth:" holding that Man had got out of the Centre of Truth—which did not need much demonstration—but had not got out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing of spirits.</span><span id="en2327"> Among these, accordingly, much discoursing with spirits went on—and it did a world of good which never became manifest.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2328"> But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed.</span><span id="en2329"> If the Day of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally correct.</span><span id="en2330"> Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever.</span><span id="en2331"> The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2332"> Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places.</span><span id="en2333"> Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off.</span><span id="en2334"> From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate "frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings."</span><span id="en2335"> At the gallows and the wheel—the axe was a rarity—Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call him, presided in this dainty dress.</span><span id="en2336"> And who among the company at Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!</span></p>
<p><span id="en2337"> Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open, and issued forth.</span><span id="en2338"> Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation!</span><span id="en2339"> As to bowing down in body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven—which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2340"> Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth.</span><span id="en2341"> There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites, and was seen no more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2342"> The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm, and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs.</span><span id="en2343"> There was soon but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2344"> "I devote you," said this person, stopping at the last door on his way, and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, "to the Devil!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2345"> With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2346"> He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask.</span><span id="en2347"> A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it.</span><span id="en2348"> The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril.</span><span id="en2349"> In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided.</span><span id="en2350"> They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance.</span><span id="en2351"> Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2352"> Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and drove away.</span><span id="en2353"> Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner.</span><span id="en2354"> It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down.</span><span id="en2355"> His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master.</span><span id="en2356"> The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner.</span><span id="en2357"> But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2358"> With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way.</span><span id="en2359"> At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2360"> But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not?</span><span id="en2361"> But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2362"> "What has gone wrong?"</span><span id="en2363"> said Monsieur, calmly looking out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2364"> A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2365"> "Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!"</span><span id="en2366"> said a ragged and submissive man, "it is a child."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2367"> "Why does he make that abominable noise?</span><span id="en2368"> Is it his child?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2369"> "Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis—it is a pity—yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2370"> The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square.</span><span id="en2371"> As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2372"> "Killed!"</span><span id="en2373"> shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him.</span><span id="en2374"> "Dead!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2375"> The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis.</span><span id="en2376"> There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger.</span><span id="en2377"> Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so.</span><span id="en2378"> The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission.</span><span id="en2379"> Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2380"> He took out his purse.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2381"> "It is extraordinary to me," said he, "that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children.</span><span id="en2382"> One or the other of you is for ever in the way.</span><span id="en2383"> How do I know what injury you have done my horses.</span><span id="en2384"> See!</span><span id="en2385"> Give him that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2386"> He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell.</span><span id="en2387"> The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, "Dead!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2388"> He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way.</span><span id="en2389"> On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it.</span><span id="en2390"> They were as silent, however, as the men.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2391"> "I know all, I know all," said the last comer.</span><span id="en2392"> "Be a brave man, my Gaspard!</span><span id="en2393"> It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live.</span><span id="en2394"> It has died in a moment without pain.</span><span id="en2395"> Could it have lived an hour as happily?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2396"> "You are a philosopher, you there," said the Marquis, smiling.</span><span id="en2397"> "How do they call you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2398"> "They call me Defarge."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2399"> "Of what trade?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2400"> "Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2401"> "Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine," said the Marquis, throwing him another gold coin, "and spend it as you will.</span><span id="en2402"> The horses there; are they right?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2403"> Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2404"> "Hold!"</span><span id="en2405"> said Monsieur the Marquis.</span><span id="en2406"> "Hold the horses!</span><span id="en2407"> Who threw that?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2408"> He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2409"> "You dogs!"</span><span id="en2410"> said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: "I would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth.</span><span id="en2411"> If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he should be crushed under the wheels."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2412"> So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised.</span><span id="en2413"> Among the men, not one.</span><span id="en2414"> But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the Marquis in the face.</span><span id="en2415"> It was not for his dignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word "Go on!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2416"> He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by.</span><span id="en2417"> The rats had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they peeped.</span><span id="en2418"> The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball—when the one woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate.</span><span id="en2419"> The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-4_htm_html_pgepubid00017">VIII. Monseigneur in the Country</h2>
<p><span id="en2420"> A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.</span><span id="en2421"> Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat.</span><span id="en2422"> On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly—a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2423"> Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill.</span><span id="en2424"> A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control—the setting sun.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2425"> The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson.</span><span id="en2426"> "It will die out," said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, "directly."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2427"> In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment.</span><span id="en2428"> When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2429"> But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison.</span><span id="en2430"> Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2431"> The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments.</span><span id="en2432"> It had its poor people too.</span><span id="en2433"> All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten.</span><span id="en2434"> Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2435"> Few children were to be seen, and no dogs.</span><span id="en2436"> As to the men and women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect—Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2437"> Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions' whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate.</span><span id="en2438"> It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.</span><span id="en2439"> He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2440"> Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court—only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate—when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2441"> "Bring me hither that fellow!"</span><span id="en2442"> said the Marquis to the courier.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2443"> The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2444"> "I passed you on the road?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2445"> "Monseigneur, it is true.</span><span id="en2446"> I had the honour of being passed on the road."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2447"> "Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2448"> "Monseigneur, it is true."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2449"> "What did you look at, so fixedly?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2450"> "Monseigneur, I looked at the man."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2451"> He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage.</span><span id="en2452"> All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2453"> "What man, pig?</span><span id="en2454"> And why look there?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2455"> "Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe—the drag."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2456"> "Who?"</span><span id="en2457"> demanded the traveller.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2458"> "Monseigneur, the man."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2459"> "May the Devil carry away these idiots!</span><span id="en2460"> How do you call the man?</span><span id="en2461"> You know all the men of this part of the country.</span><span id="en2462"> Who was he?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2463"> "Your clemency, Monseigneur!</span><span id="en2464"> He was not of this part of the country.</span><span id="en2465"> Of all the days of my life, I never saw him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2466"> "Swinging by the chain?</span><span id="en2467"> To be suffocated?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2468"> "With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2469"> His head hanging over—like this!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2470"> He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2471"> "What was he like?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2472"> "Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller.</span><span id="en2473"> All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2474"> The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis.</span><span id="en2475"> Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2476"> "Truly, you did well," said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, "to see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours.</span><span id="en2477"> Bah!</span><span id="en2478"> Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2479"> Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2480"> "Bah!</span><span id="en2481"> Go aside!"</span><span id="en2482"> said Monsieur Gabelle.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2483"> "Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2484"> "Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2485"> "Did he run away, fellow?</span><span id="en2486"> —where is that Accursed?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2487"> The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap.</span><span id="en2488"> Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2489"> "Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2490"> "Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as a person plunges into the river."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2491"> "See to it, Gabelle.</span><span id="en2492"> Go on!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2493"> The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they might not have been so fortunate.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2494"> The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill.</span><span id="en2495"> Gradually, it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night.</span><span id="en2496"> The postilions, with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2497"> At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied the figure from the life—his own life, maybe—for it was dreadfully spare and thin.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2498"> To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling.</span><span id="en2499"> She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2500"> "It is you, Monseigneur!</span><span id="en2501"> Monseigneur, a petition."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2502"> With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2503"> "How, then!</span><span id="en2504"> What is it?</span><span id="en2505"> Always petitions!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2506"> "Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2507"> For the love of the great God!</span><span id="en2508"> My husband, the forester."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2509"> "What of your husband, the forester?</span><span id="en2510"> Always the same with you people.</span><span id="en2511"> He cannot pay something?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2512"> "He has paid all, Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2513"> He is dead."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2514"> "Well!</span><span id="en2515"> He is quiet.</span><span id="en2516"> Can I restore him to you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2517"> "Alas, no, Monseigneur!</span><span id="en2518"> But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2519"> "Well?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2520"> "Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2521"> "Again, well?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2522"> She looked an old woman, but was young.</span><span id="en2523"> Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door—tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2524"> "Monseigneur, hear me!</span><span id="en2525"> Monseigneur, hear my petition!</span><span id="en2526"> My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2527"> "Again, well?</span><span id="en2528"> Can I feed them?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2529"> "Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it.</span><span id="en2530"> My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed over him to show where he lies.</span><span id="en2531"> Otherwise, the place will be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.</span><span id="en2532"> Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want.</span><span id="en2533"> Monseigneur!</span><span id="en2534"> Monseigneur!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2535"> The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2536"> The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it.</span><span id="en2537"> By degrees, as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2538"> The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door of his chateau was opened to him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2539"> "Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2540"> "Monseigneur, not yet."</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-4_htm_html_pgepubid00018">IX. The Gorgon's Head</h2>
<p><span id="en2541"> It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door.</span><span id="en2542"> A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions.</span><span id="en2543"> As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2544"> Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees.</span><span id="en2545"> All else was so quiet, that the flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in the open night-air.</span><span id="en2546"> Other sound than the owl's voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2547"> The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord was angry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2548"> Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up the staircase to a door in a corridor.</span><span id="en2549"> This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two others.</span><span id="en2550"> High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.</span><span id="en2551"> The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to break—the fourteenth Louis—was conspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2552"> A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round room, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers.</span><span id="en2553"> A small lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2554"> "My nephew," said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; "they said he was not arrived."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2555"> Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2556"> "Ah!</span><span id="en2557"> It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the table as it is.</span><span id="en2558"> I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2559"> In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper.</span><span id="en2560"> His chair was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lips, when he put it down.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2561"> "What is that?"</span><span id="en2562"> he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2563"> "Monseigneur?</span><span id="en2564"> That?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2565"> "Outside the blinds.</span><span id="en2566"> Open the blinds."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2567"> It was done.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2568"> "Well?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2569"> "Monseigneur, it is nothing.</span><span id="en2570"> The trees and the night are all that are here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2571"> The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round for instructions.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2572"> "Good," said the imperturbable master.</span><span id="en2573"> "Close them again."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2574"> That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper.</span><span id="en2575"> He was half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand, hearing the sound of wheels.</span><span id="en2576"> It came on briskly, and came up to the front of the chateau.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2577"> "Ask who is arrived."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2578"> It was the nephew of Monseigneur.</span><span id="en2579"> He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon.</span><span id="en2580"> He had diminished the distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.</span><span id="en2581"> He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2582"> He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and there, and that he was prayed to come to it.</span><span id="en2583"> In a little while he came.</span><span id="en2584"> He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2585"> Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake hands.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2586"> "You left Paris yesterday, sir?"</span><span id="en2587"> he said to Monseigneur, as he took his seat at table.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2588"> "Yesterday.</span><span id="en2589"> And you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2590"> "I come direct."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2591"> "From London?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2592"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2593"> "You have been a long time coming," said the Marquis, with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2594"> "On the contrary; I come direct."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2595"> "Pardon me!</span><span id="en2596"> I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2597"> "I have been detained by"—the nephew stopped a moment in his answer—"various business."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2598"> "Without doubt," said the polished uncle.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2599"> So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.</span><span id="en2600"> When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2601"> "I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away.</span><span id="en2602"> It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2603"> "Not to death," said the uncle; "it is not necessary to say, to death."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2604"> "I doubt, sir," returned the nephew, "whether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2605"> The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2606"> "Indeed, sir," pursued the nephew, "for anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2607"> "No, no, no," said the uncle, pleasantly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2608"> "But, however that may be," resumed the nephew, glancing at him with deep distrust, "I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2609"> "My friend, I told you so," said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks.</span><span id="en2610"> "Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2611"> "I recall it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2612"> "Thank you," said the Marquis—very sweetly indeed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2613"> His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2614"> "In effect, sir," pursued the nephew, "I believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in France here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2615"> "I do not quite understand," returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.</span><span id="en2616"> "Dare I ask you to explain?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2617"> "I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2618"> "It is possible," said the uncle, with great calmness.</span><span id="en2619"> "For the honour of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.</span><span id="en2620"> Pray excuse me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2621"> "I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one," observed the nephew.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2622"> "I would not say happily, my friend," returned the uncle, with refined politeness; "I would not be sure of that.</span><span id="en2623"> A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself.</span><span id="en2624"> But it is useless to discuss the question.</span><span id="en2625"> I am, as you say, at a disadvantage.</span><span id="en2626"> These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity.</span><span id="en2627"> They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so few!</span><span id="en2628"> It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the worse.</span><span id="en2629"> Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar.</span><span id="en2630"> From this room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter—his daughter?</span><span id="en2631"> We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience.</span><span id="en2632"> All very bad, very bad!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2633"> The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself, that great means of regeneration.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2634"> "We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern time also," said the nephew, gloomily, "that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2635"> "Let us hope so," said the uncle.</span><span id="en2636"> "Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2637"> "There is not," pursued the nephew, in his former tone, "a face I can look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2638"> "A compliment," said the Marquis, "to the grandeur of the family, merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.</span><span id="en2639"> Hah!"</span><span id="en2640"> And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2641"> But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2642"> "Repression is the only lasting philosophy.</span><span id="en2643"> The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend," observed the Marquis, "will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof," looking up to it, "shuts out the sky."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2644"> That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed.</span><span id="en2645"> If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains.</span><span id="en2646"> As for the roof he vaunted, he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new way—to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2647"> "Meanwhile," said the Marquis, "I will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not.</span><span id="en2648"> But you must be fatigued.</span><span id="en2649"> Shall we terminate our conference for the night?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2650"> "A moment more."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2651"> "An hour, if you please."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2652"> "Sir," said the nephew, "we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2653"> "We have done wrong?"</span><span id="en2654"> repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2655"> "Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account to both of us, in such different ways.</span><span id="en2656"> Even in my father's time, we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure, whatever it was.</span><span id="en2657"> Why need I speak of my father's time, when it is equally yours?</span><span id="en2658"> Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2659"> "Death has done that!"</span><span id="en2660"> said the Marquis.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2661"> "And has left me," answered the nephew, "bound to a system that is frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2662"> "Seeking them from me, my nephew," said the Marquis, touching him on the breast with his forefinger—they were now standing by the hearth—"you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2663"> Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2664"> "My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have lived."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2665"> When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his box in his pocket.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2666"> "Better to be a rational creature," he added then, after ringing a small bell on the table, "and accept your natural destiny.</span><span id="en2667"> But you are lost, Monsieur Charles, I see."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2668"> "This property and France are lost to me," said the nephew, sadly; "I renounce them."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2669"> "Are they both yours to renounce?</span><span id="en2670"> France may be, but is the property?</span><span id="en2671"> It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2672"> "I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2673"> "Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable."</span></p>

<p><span id="en2674"> "You do me too much honour," said the Marquis; "still, I prefer that supposition."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2675"> "—I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere.</span><span id="en2676"> It is little to relinquish.</span><span id="en2677"> What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2678"> "Hah!"</span><span id="en2679"> said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2680"> "To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2681"> "Hah!"</span><span id="en2682"> said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2683"> "If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me.</span><span id="en2684"> There is a curse on it, and on all this land."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2685"> "And you?"</span><span id="en2686"> said the uncle.</span><span id="en2687"> "Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new philosophy, graciously intend to live?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2688"> "I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day—work."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2689"> "In England, for example?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2690"> "Yes.</span><span id="en2691"> The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country.</span><span id="en2692"> The family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2693"> The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted.</span><span id="en2694"> It now shone brightly, through the door of communication.</span><span id="en2695"> The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his valet.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2696"> "England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have prospered there," he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2697"> "I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may be indebted to you, sir.</span><span id="en2698"> For the rest, it is my Refuge."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2699"> "They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many.</span><span id="en2700"> You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there?</span><span id="en2701"> A Doctor?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2702"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2703"> "With a daughter?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2704"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2705"> "Yes," said the Marquis.</span><span id="en2706"> "You are fatigued.</span><span id="en2707"> Good night!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2708"> As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words, which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly.</span><span id="en2709"> At the same time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2710"> "Yes," repeated the Marquis.</span><span id="en2711"> "A Doctor with a daughter.</span><span id="en2712"> Yes.</span><span id="en2713"> So commences the new philosophy!</span><span id="en2714"> You are fatigued.</span><span id="en2715"> Good night!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2716"> It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his.</span><span id="en2717"> The nephew looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2718"> "Good night!"</span><span id="en2719"> said the uncle.</span><span id="en2720"> "I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning.</span><span id="en2721"> Good repose!</span><span id="en2722"> Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!</span><span id="en2723"> —And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will," he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2724"> The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night.</span><span id="en2725"> Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:—looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2726"> He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage.</span><span id="en2727"> That fountain suggested the Paris fountain, the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the tall man with his arms up, crying, "Dead!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2728"> "I am cool now," said Monsieur the Marquis, "and may go to bed."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2729"> So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2730"> The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets.</span><span id="en2731"> But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2732"> For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night.</span><span id="en2733"> Dead darkness lay on all the landscape, dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.</span><span id="en2734"> The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it.</span><span id="en2735"> In the village, taxers and taxed were fast asleep.</span><span id="en2736"> Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2737"> The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard—both melting away, like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time—through three dark hours.</span><span id="en2738"> Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2739"> Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees, and poured its radiance over the hill.</span><span id="en2740"> In the glow, the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned.</span><span id="en2741"> The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.</span><span id="en2742"> At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2743"> Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village.</span><span id="en2744"> Casement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth shivering—chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air.</span><span id="en2745"> Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population.</span><span id="en2746"> Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside.</span><span id="en2747"> In the church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2748"> The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and surely.</span><span id="en2749"> First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2750"> All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the return of morning.</span><span id="en2751"> Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?</span></p>
<p><span id="en2752"> What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to peck at, on a heap of stones?</span><span id="en2753"> Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds?</span><span id="en2754"> Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the fountain.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2755"> All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise.</span><span id="en2756"> The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter.</span><span id="en2757"> Some of the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing.</span><span id="en2758"> Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap.</span><span id="en2759"> What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora?</span></p>
<p><span id="en2760"> It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2761"> The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2762"> It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis.</span><span id="en2763"> It was like a fine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified.</span><span id="en2764"> Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2765"> "Drive him fast to his tomb.</span><span id="en2766"> This, from Jacques."</span></p>

<p><span id="en2767"> More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr.</span><span id="en2768"> Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature.</span><span id="en2769"> In this age, he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor.</span><span id="en2770"> He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy.</span><span id="en2771"> He could write of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound English.</span><span id="en2772"> Such masters were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters.</span><span id="en2773"> As a tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr.</span><span id="en2774"> Darnay soon became known and encouraged.</span><span id="en2775"> He was well acquainted, more-over, with the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.</span><span id="en2776"> So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2777"> In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he would not have prospered.</span><span id="en2778"> He had expected labour, and he found it, and did it and made the best of it.</span><span id="en2779"> In this, his prosperity consisted.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2780"> A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the Custom-house.</span><span id="en2781"> The rest of his time he passed in London.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2782"> Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way—Charles Darnay's way—the way of the love of a woman.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2783"> He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger.</span><span id="en2784"> He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him.</span><span id="en2785"> But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads—the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream—had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2786"> That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well.</span><span id="en2787"> It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en2788"> It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2789"> He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window.</span><span id="en2790"> The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him.</span><span id="en2791"> He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action.</span><span id="en2792"> In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2793"> He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful.</span><span id="en2794"> To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2795"> "Charles Darnay!</span><span id="en2796"> I rejoice to see you.</span><span id="en2797"> We have been counting on your return these three or four days past.</span><span id="en2798"> Mr.</span><span id="en2799"> Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2800"> "I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter," he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2801"> "Is well," said the Doctor, as he stopped short, "and your return will delight us all.</span><span id="en2802"> She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2803"> "Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home.</span><span id="en2804"> I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2805"> There was a blank silence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2806"> "Yes?"</span><span id="en2807"> said the Doctor, with evident constraint.</span><span id="en2808"> "Bring your chair here, and speak on."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2809"> He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy.</span></p>

<p><span id="en2810"> He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2811"> "Is Lucie the topic?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2812"> "She is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2813"> "It is hard for me to speak of her at any time.</span><span id="en2814"> It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2815"> "It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!"</span><span id="en2816"> he said deferentially.</span></p>

<p><span id="en2817"> "I believe it.</span><span id="en2818"> I do you justice; I believe it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2819"> His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2820"> "Shall I go on, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2821"> Another blank.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2822"> "Yes, go on."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2823"> "You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden.</span><span id="en2824"> Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly.</span><span id="en2825"> If ever there were love in the world, I love her.</span><span id="en2826"> You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2827"> The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2828"> "Not that, sir!</span><span id="en2829"> Let that be!</span><span id="en2830"> I adjure you, do not recall that!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2831"> His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased.</span><span id="en2832"> He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause.</span><span id="en2833"> The latter so received it, and remained silent.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2834"> "I ask your pardon," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments.</span><span id="en2835"> "I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2836"> He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2837"> "Have you spoken to Lucie?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2838"> "No."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2839"> "Nor written?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2840"> "Never."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2841"> "It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father.</span><span id="en2842"> Her father thanks you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2843"> He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2844"> "I know," said Darnay, respectfully, "how can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child.</span><span id="en2845"> I know, Doctor Manette—how can I fail to know—that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself.</span><span id="en2846"> I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her.</span><span id="en2847"> I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her.</span><span id="en2848"> I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck.</span><span id="en2849"> I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration.</span><span id="en2850"> I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2851"> Her father sat silent, with his face bent down.</span><span id="en2852"> His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2853"> "Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it.</span><span id="en2854"> I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love—even mine—between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself.</span><span id="en2855"> But I love her.</span><span id="en2856"> Heaven is my witness that I love her!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2857"> "I believe it," answered her father, mournfully.</span><span id="en2858"> "I have thought so before now.</span><span id="en2859"> I believe it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2860"> "But, do not believe," said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound, "that if my fortune were so cast as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a word of what I now say.</span><span id="en2861"> Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I should know it to be a baseness.</span><span id="en2862"> If I had any such possibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my heart—if it ever had been there—if it ever could be there—I could not now touch this honoured hand."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2863"> He laid his own upon it as he spoke.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2864"> "No, dear Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en2865"> Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your life and home, and being faithful to you to the death.</span><span id="en2866"> Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2867"> His touch still lingered on her father's hand.</span><span id="en2868"> Answering the touch for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference.</span><span id="en2869"> A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2870"> "You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart—or nearly so.</span><span id="en2871"> Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2872"> "None.</span><span id="en2873"> As yet, none."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2874"> "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2875"> "Not even so.</span><span id="en2876"> I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2877"> "Do you seek any guidance from me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2878"> "I ask none, sir.</span><span id="en2879"> But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2880"> "Do you seek any promise from me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2881"> "I do seek that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2882"> "What is it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2883"> "I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope.</span><span id="en2884"> I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart—do not think I have the presumption to assume so much—I could retain no place in it against her love for her father."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2885"> "If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2886"> "I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all the world.</span><span id="en2887"> For which reason, Doctor Manette," said Darnay, modestly but firmly, "I would not ask that word, to save my life."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2888"> "I am sure of it.</span><span id="en2889"> Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate.</span><span id="en2890"> My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2891"> "May I ask, sir, if you think she is—" As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2892"> "Is sought by any other suitor?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2893"> "It is what I meant to say."</span></p>

<p><span id="en2894"> "You have seen Mr.</span><span id="en2895"> Carton here, yourself.</span><span id="en2896"> Mr.</span><span id="en2897"> Stryver is here too, occasionally.</span><span id="en2898"> If it be at all, it can only be by one of these."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2899"> "Or both," said Darnay.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2900"> "I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely.</span><span id="en2901"> You want a promise from me.</span><span id="en2902"> Tell me what it is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2903"> "It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it.</span><span id="en2904"> I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me.</span><span id="en2905"> I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask.</span><span id="en2906"> The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2907"> "I give the promise," said the Doctor, "without any condition.</span><span id="en2908"> I believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it.</span><span id="en2909"> I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self.</span><span id="en2910"> If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.</span></p>

<p><span id="en2911"> "—any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved—the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head—they should all be obliterated for her sake.</span><span id="en2912"> She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me—Well!</span><span id="en2913"> This is idle talk."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2914"> So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2915"> "You said something to me," said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.</span><span id="en2916"> "What was it you said to me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2917"> He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2918"> "Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part.</span><span id="en2919"> My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is not, as you will remember, my own.</span><span id="en2920"> I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2921"> "Stop!"</span><span id="en2922"> said the Doctor of Beauvais.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2923"> "I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2924"> "Stop!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2925"> For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2926"> "Tell me when I ask you, not now.</span><span id="en2927"> If your suit should prosper, if Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning.</span><span id="en2928"> Do you promise?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2929"> "Willingly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2930"> "Give me your hand.</span><span id="en2931"> She will be home directly, and it is better she should not see us together to-night.</span><span id="en2932"> Go!</span><span id="en2933"> God bless you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2934"> It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone—for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs—and was surprised to find his reading-chair empty.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2935"> "My father!"</span><span id="en2936"> she called to him.</span><span id="en2937"> "Father dear!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2938"> Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom.</span><span id="en2939"> Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her blood all chilled, "What shall I do!</span><span id="en2940"> What shall I do!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2941"> Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at his door, and softly called to him.</span><span id="en2942"> The noise ceased at the sound of her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down together for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2943"> She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night.</span><span id="en2944"> He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-5_htm_html_pgepubid00020">XI. A Companion Picture</h2>
<p><span id="en2945"> "Sydney," said Mr.</span><span id="en2946"> Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his jackal; "mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2947"> Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr.</span><span id="en2948"> Stryver's papers before the setting in of the long vacation.</span><span id="en2949"> The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2950"> Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application.</span><span id="en2951"> It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2952"> "Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?"</span><span id="en2953"> said Stryver the portly, with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2954"> "I am."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2955"> "Now, look here!</span><span id="en2956"> I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me.</span><span id="en2957"> I intend to marry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2958"> "Do you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2959"> "Yes.</span><span id="en2960"> And not for money.</span><span id="en2961"> What do you say now?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2962"> "I don't feel disposed to say much.</span><span id="en2963"> Who is she?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2964"> "Guess."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2965"> "Do I know her?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2966"> "Guess."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2967"> "I am not going to guess, at five o'clock in the morning, with my brains frying and sputtering in my head.</span><span id="en2968"> If you want me to guess, you must ask me to dinner."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2969"> "Well then, I'll tell you," said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting posture.</span><span id="en2970"> "Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you, because you are such an insensible dog."</span></p>

<p><span id="en2971"> "Come!"</span><span id="en2972"> rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, "though I don't prefer any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2973"> "You are a luckier, if you mean that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2974"> "I don't mean that.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2975"> "Say gallantry, while you are about it," suggested Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2976"> "Well!</span><span id="en2977"> I'll say gallantry.</span><span id="en2978"> My meaning is that I am a man," said Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, "who cares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2979"> "Go on," said Sydney Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2980"> "No; but before I go on," said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way, "I'll have this out with you.</span><span id="en2981"> You've been at Doctor Manette's house as much as I have, or more than I have.</span><span id="en2982"> Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there!</span><span id="en2983"> Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you, Sydney!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2984"> "It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything," returned Sydney; "you ought to be much obliged to me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2985"> "You shall not get off in that way," rejoined Stryver, shouldering the rejoinder at him; "no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you—and I tell you to your face to do you good—that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society.</span><span id="en2986"> You are a disagreeable fellow."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2987"> Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2988"> "Look at me!"</span><span id="en2989"> said Stryver, squaring himself; "I have less need to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.</span><span id="en2990"> Why do I do it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2991"> "I never saw you do it yet," muttered Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2992"> "I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle.</span><span id="en2993"> And look at me!</span><span id="en2994"> I get on."</span></p>
<p><span id="en2995"> "You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions," answered Carton, with a careless air; "I wish you would keep to that.</span><span id="en2996"> As to me—will you never understand that I am incorrigible?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en2997"> He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2998"> "You have no business to be incorrigible," was his friend's answer, delivered in no very soothing tone.</span></p>
<p><span id="en2999"> "I have no business to be, at all, that I know of," said Sydney Carton.</span><span id="en3000"> "Who is the lady?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3001"> "Now, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney," said Mr.</span><span id="en3002"> Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, "because I know you don't mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance.</span><span id="en3003"> I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3004"> "I did?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3005"> "Certainly; and in these chambers."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3006"> Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3007"> "You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll.</span><span id="en3008"> The young lady is Miss Manette.</span><span id="en3009"> If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.</span><span id="en3010"> You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear for music."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3011"> Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his friend.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3012"> "Now you know all about it, Syd," said Mr.</span><span id="en3013"> Stryver.</span><span id="en3014"> "I don't care about fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself.</span><span id="en3015"> She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but she is worthy of good fortune.</span><span id="en3016"> Are you astonished?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3017"> Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, "Why should I be astonished?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3018"> "You approve?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3019"> Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, "Why should I not approve?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3020"> "Well!"</span><span id="en3021"> said his friend Stryver, "you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will.</span><span id="en3022"> Yes, Sydney, I have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit.</span><span id="en3023"> So I have made up my mind.</span><span id="en3024"> And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say a word to you about your prospects.</span><span id="en3025"> You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad way.</span><span id="en3026"> You don't know the value of money, you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you really ought to think about a nurse."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3027"> The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3028"> "Now, let me recommend you," pursued Stryver, "to look it in the face.</span><span id="en3029"> I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face, you, in your different way.</span><span id="en3030"> Marry.</span><span id="en3031"> Provide somebody to take care of you.</span><span id="en3032"> Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it.</span><span id="en3033"> Find out somebody.</span><span id="en3034"> Find out some respectable woman with a little property—somebody in the landlady way, or lodging-letting way—and marry her, against a rainy day.</span><span id="en3035"> That's the kind of thing for you.</span><span id="en3036"> Now think of it, Sydney."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3037"> "I'll think of it," said Sydney.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-5_htm_html_pgepubid00021">XII. The Fellow of Delicacy</h2>
<p><span id="en3038"> Mr.</span><span id="en3039"> Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation.</span><span id="en3040"> After some mental debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it and Hilary.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3041"> As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly saw his way to the verdict.</span><span id="en3042"> Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds—the only grounds ever worth taking into account—it was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it.</span><span id="en3043"> He called himself for the plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider.</span><span id="en3044"> After trying it, Stryver, C.</span><span id="en3045"> ., was satisfied that no plainer case could be.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3046"> Accordingly, Mr.</span><span id="en3047"> Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3048"> Towards Soho, therefore, Mr.</span><span id="en3049"> Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple, while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.</span><span id="en3050"> Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have seen how safe and strong he was.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3051"> His way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and knowing Mr.</span><span id="en3052"> Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.</span><span id="en3053"> Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr.</span><span id="en3054"> Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon.</span><span id="en3055"> So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.</span><span id="en3056"> Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything under the clouds were a sum.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3057"> "Halloa!"</span><span id="en3058"> said Mr.</span><span id="en3059"> Stryver.</span><span id="en3060"> "How do you do?</span><span id="en3061"> I hope you are well!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3062"> It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place, or space.</span><span id="en3063"> He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall.</span><span id="en3064"> The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3065"> The discreet Mr.</span><span id="en3066"> Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, "How do you do, Mr.</span><span id="en3067"> Stryver?</span><span id="en3068"> How do you do, sir?"</span><span id="en3069"> and shook hands.</span><span id="en3070"> There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air.</span><span id="en3071"> He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3072"> "Can I do anything for you, Mr.</span><span id="en3073"> Stryver?"</span><span id="en3074"> asked Mr.</span><span id="en3075"> Lorry, in his business character.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3076"> "Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr.</span><span id="en3077"> Lorry; I have come for a private word."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3078"> "Oh indeed!"</span><span id="en3079"> said Mr.</span><span id="en3080"> Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3081"> "I am going," said Mr.</span><span id="en3082"> Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: "I am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr.</span><span id="en3083"> Lorry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3084"> "Oh dear me!"</span><span id="en3085"> cried Mr.</span><span id="en3086"> Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3087"> "Oh dear me, sir?"</span><span id="en3088"> repeated Stryver, drawing back.</span><span id="en3089"> "Oh dear you, sir?</span><span id="en3090"> What may your meaning be, Mr.</span><span id="en3091"> Lorry?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3092"> "My meaning," answered the man of business, "is, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and—in short, my meaning is everything you could desire.</span><span id="en3093"> But—really, you know, Mr.</span><span id="en3094"> Stryver—" Mr.</span><span id="en3095"> Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, "you know there really is so much too much of you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3096"> "Well!"</span><span id="en3097"> said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, "if I understand you, Mr.</span><span id="en3098"> Lorry, I'll be hanged!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3099"> Mr.</span><span id="en3100"> Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3101"> "D—n it all, sir!"</span><span id="en3102"> said Stryver, staring at him, "am I not eligible?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3103"> "Oh dear yes!</span><span id="en3104"> Yes.</span><span id="en3105"> Oh yes, you're eligible!"</span><span id="en3106"> said Mr.</span><span id="en3107"> Lorry.</span><span id="en3108"> "If you say eligible, you are eligible."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3109"> "Am I not prosperous?"</span><span id="en3110"> asked Stryver.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3111"> "Oh!</span><span id="en3112"> if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous," said Mr.</span><span id="en3113"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3114"> "And advancing?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3115"> "If you come to advancing you know," said Mr.</span><span id="en3116"> Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, "nobody can doubt that."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3117"> "Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr.</span><span id="en3118"> Lorry?"</span><span id="en3119"> demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3120"> "Well!</span><span id="en3121"> I—Were you going there now?"</span><span id="en3122"> asked Mr.</span><span id="en3123"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3124"> "Straight!"</span><span id="en3125"> said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3126"> "Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3127"> "Why?"</span><span id="en3128"> said Stryver.</span><span id="en3129"> "Now, I'll put you in a corner," forensically shaking a forefinger at him.</span><span id="en3130"> "You are a man of business and bound to have a reason.</span><span id="en3131"> State your reason.</span><span id="en3132"> Why wouldn't you go?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3133"> "Because," said Mr.</span><span id="en3134"> Lorry, "I wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3135"> "D—n me!"</span><span id="en3136"> cried Stryver, "but this beats everything."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3137"> Mr.</span><span id="en3138"> Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3139"> "Here's a man of business—a man of years—a man of experience—in a Bank," said Stryver; "and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success, he says there's no reason at all!</span><span id="en3140"> Says it with his head on!"</span><span id="en3141"> Mr.</span><span id="en3142"> Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3143"> "When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady.</span><span id="en3144"> The young lady, my good sir," said Mr.</span><span id="en3145"> Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, "the young lady.</span><span id="en3146"> The young lady goes before all."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3147"> "Then you mean to tell me, Mr.</span><span id="en3148"> Lorry," said Stryver, squaring his elbows, "that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3149"> "Not exactly so.</span><span id="en3150"> I mean to tell you, Mr.</span><span id="en3151"> Stryver," said Mr.</span><span id="en3152"> Lorry, reddening, "that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man—which I hope I do not—whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3153"> The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr.</span><span id="en3154"> Stryver's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry; Mr.</span><span id="en3155"> Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in no better state now it was his turn.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3156"> "That is what I mean to tell you, sir," said Mr.</span><span id="en3157"> Lorry.</span><span id="en3158"> "Pray let there be no mistake about it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3159"> Mr.</span><span id="en3160"> Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3161"> "This is something new to me, Mr.</span><span id="en3162"> Lorry.</span><span id="en3163"> You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself—myself, Stryver of the King's Bench bar?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3164"> "Do you ask me for my advice, Mr.</span><span id="en3165"> Stryver?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3166"> "Yes, I do."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3167"> "Very good.</span><span id="en3168"> Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3169"> "And all I can say of it is," laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, "that this—ha, ha!</span><span id="en3170"> —beats everything past, present, and to come."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3171"> "Now understand me," pursued Mr.</span><span id="en3172"> Lorry.</span><span id="en3173"> "As a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it.</span><span id="en3174"> But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken.</span><span id="en3175"> The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect.</span><span id="en3176"> Now, you think I may not be right?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3177"> "Not I!"</span><span id="en3178"> said Stryver, whistling.</span><span id="en3179"> "I can't undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself.</span><span id="en3180"> I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense.</span><span id="en3181"> It's new to me, but you are right, I dare say."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3182"> "What I suppose, Mr.</span><span id="en3183"> Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself—And understand me, sir," said Mr.</span><span id="en3184"> Lorry, quickly flushing again, "I will not—not even at Tellson's—have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3185"> "There!</span><span id="en3186"> I beg your pardon!"</span><span id="en3187"> said Stryver.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3188"> "Granted.</span><span id="en3189"> Thank you.</span><span id="en3190"> Well, Mr.</span><span id="en3191"> Stryver, I was about to say:—it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you.</span><span id="en3192"> You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family.</span><span id="en3193"> If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it.</span><span id="en3194"> If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared.</span><span id="en3195"> What do you say?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3196"> "How long would you keep me in town?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3197"> "Oh!</span><span id="en3198"> It is only a question of a few hours.</span><span id="en3199"> I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3200"> "Then I say yes," said Stryver: "I won't go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night.</span><span id="en3201"> Good morning."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3202"> Then Mr.</span><span id="en3203"> Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks.</span><span id="en3204"> Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3205"> The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty.</span><span id="en3206"> Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow, he got it down.</span><span id="en3207"> "And now," said Mr.</span><span id="en3208"> Stryver, shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, "my way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3209"> It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found great relief.</span><span id="en3210"> "You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady," said Mr.</span><span id="en3211"> Stryver; "I'll do that for you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3212"> Accordingly, when Mr.</span><span id="en3213"> Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock, Mr.</span><span id="en3214"> Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning.</span><span id="en3215"> He even showed surprise when he saw Mr.</span><span id="en3216"> Lorry, and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3217"> "Well!"</span><span id="en3218"> said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question.</span><span id="en3219"> "I have been to Soho."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3220"> "To Soho?"</span><span id="en3221"> repeated Mr.</span><span id="en3222"> Stryver, coldly.</span><span id="en3223"> "Oh, to be sure!</span><span id="en3224"> What am I thinking of!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3225"> "And I have no doubt," said Mr.</span><span id="en3226"> Lorry, "that I was right in the conversation we had.</span><span id="en3227"> My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3228"> "I assure you," returned Mr.</span><span id="en3229"> Stryver, in the friendliest way, "that I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's account.</span><span id="en3230"> I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more about it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3231"> "I don't understand you," said Mr.</span><span id="en3232"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3233"> "I dare say not," rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and final way; "no matter, no matter."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3234"> "But it does matter," Mr.</span><span id="en3235"> Lorry urged.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3236"> "No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't.</span><span id="en3237"> Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done.</span><span id="en3238"> Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before.</span><span id="en3239"> In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view—it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it.</span><span id="en3240"> There is no harm at all done.</span><span id="en3241"> I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent.</span><span id="en3242"> Mr.</span><span id="en3243"> Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed.</span><span id="en3244"> Now, pray say no more about it.</span><span id="en3245"> I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.</span><span id="en3246"> And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3247"> Mr.</span><span id="en3248"> Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.</span><span id="en3249"> Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.</span><span id="en3250"> "Make the best of it, my dear sir," said Stryver; "say no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3251"> Mr.</span><span id="en3252"> Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was.</span><span id="en3253"> Mr.</span><span id="en3254"> Stryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-5_htm_html_pgepubid00022">XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy</h2>
<p><span id="en3255"> If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en3256"> He had been there often, during a whole year, and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there.</span><span id="en3257"> When he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3258"> And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements.</span><span id="en3259"> Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his mind.</span><span id="en3260"> Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3261"> On a day in August, when Mr.</span><span id="en3262"> Stryver (after notifying to his jackal that "he had thought better of that marrying matter") had carried his delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod those stones.</span><span id="en3263"> From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him to the Doctor's door.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3264"> He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone.</span><span id="en3265"> She had never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table.</span><span id="en3266"> But, looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed a change in it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3267"> "I fear you are not well, Mr.</span><span id="en3268"> Carton!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3269"> "No.</span><span id="en3270"> But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health.</span><span id="en3271"> What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3272"> "Is it not—forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips—a pity to live no better life?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3273"> "God knows it is a shame!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3274"> "Then why not change it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3275"> Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3276"> "It is too late for that.</span><span id="en3277"> I shall never be better than I am.</span><span id="en3278"> I shall sink lower, and be worse."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3279"> He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand.</span><span id="en3280"> The table trembled in the silence that followed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3281"> She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3282"> "Pray forgive me, Miss Manette.</span><span id="en3283"> I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you.</span><span id="en3284"> Will you hear me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3285"> "If it will do you any good, Mr.</span><span id="en3286"> Carton, if it would make you happier, it would make me very glad!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3287"> "God bless you for your sweet compassion!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3288"> He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3289"> "Don't be afraid to hear me.</span><span id="en3290"> Don't shrink from anything I say.</span><span id="en3291"> I am like one who died young.</span><span id="en3292"> All my life might have been."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3293"> "No, Mr.</span><span id="en3294"> Carton.</span><span id="en3295"> I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3296"> "Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better—although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better—I shall never forget it!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3297"> She was pale and trembling.</span><span id="en3298"> He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3299"> "If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself—flung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be—he would have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him.</span><span id="en3300"> I know very well that you can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot be."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3301"> "Without it, can I not save you, Mr.</span><span id="en3302"> Carton?</span><span id="en3303"> Can I not recall you—forgive me again!</span><span id="en3304"> —to a better course?</span><span id="en3305"> Can I in no way repay your confidence?</span><span id="en3306"> I know this is a confidence," she modestly said, after a little hesitation, and in earnest tears, "I know you would say this to no one else.</span><span id="en3307"> Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr.</span><span id="en3308"> Carton?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3309"> He shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3310"> "To none.</span><span id="en3311"> No, Miss Manette, to none.</span><span id="en3312"> If you will hear me through a very little more, all you can ever do for me is done.</span><span id="en3313"> I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul.</span><span id="en3314"> In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me.</span><span id="en3315"> Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever.</span><span id="en3316"> I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight.</span><span id="en3317"> A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3318"> "Will nothing of it remain?</span><span id="en3319"> O Mr.</span><span id="en3320"> Carton, think again!</span><span id="en3321"> Try again!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3322"> "No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving.</span><span id="en3323"> And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire—a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3324"> "Since it is my misfortune, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3325"> "Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could.</span><span id="en3326"> You will not be the cause of my becoming worse."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3327"> "Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of mine—this is what I mean, if I can make it plain—can I use no influence to serve you?</span><span id="en3328"> Have I no power for good, with you, at all?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3329"> "The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come here to realise.</span><span id="en3330"> Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3331"> "Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr.</span><span id="en3332"> Carton!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3333"> "Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette.</span><span id="en3334"> I have proved myself, and I know better.</span><span id="en3335"> I distress you; I draw fast to an end.</span><span id="en3336"> Will you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3337"> "If that will be a consolation to you, yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3338"> "Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3339"> "Mr.</span><span id="en3340"> Carton," she answered, after an agitated pause, "the secret is yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3341"> "Thank you.</span><span id="en3342"> And again, God bless you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3343"> He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3344"> "Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word.</span><span id="en3345"> I will never refer to it again.</span><span id="en3346"> If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth.</span><span id="en3347"> In the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance—and shall thank and bless you for it—that my last avowal of myself was made to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in your heart.</span><span id="en3348"> May it otherwise be light and happy!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3349"> He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3350"> "Be comforted!"</span><span id="en3351"> he said, "I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette.</span><span id="en3352"> An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any wretch who creeps along the streets.</span><span id="en3353"> Be comforted!</span><span id="en3354"> But, within myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me.</span><span id="en3355"> The last supplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3356"> "I will, Mr.</span><span id="en3357"> Carton."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3358"> "My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and between whom and you there is an impassable space.</span><span id="en3359"> It is useless to say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul.</span><span id="en3360"> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.</span><span id="en3361"> If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.</span><span id="en3362"> Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing.</span><span id="en3363"> The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you—ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn—the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you.</span><span id="en3364"> O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3365"> He said, "Farewell!"</span><span id="en3366"> said a last "God bless you!"</span><span id="en3367"> and left her.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-6_htm_html_pgepubid00023">XIV. The Honest Tradesman</h2>
<p><span id="en3368"> To the eyes of Mr.</span><span id="en3369"> Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented.</span><span id="en3370"> Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down!</span></p>
<p><span id="en3371"> With his straw in his mouth, Mr.</span><span id="en3372"> Cruncher sat watching the two streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream—saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry.</span><span id="en3373"> Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore.</span><span id="en3374"> Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr.</span><span id="en3375"> Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health.</span><span id="en3376"> And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3377"> Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in the sight of men.</span><span id="en3378"> Mr.</span><span id="en3379"> Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3380"> It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.</span><span id="en3381"> Cruncher must have been "flopping" in some pointed manner, when an unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his attention.</span><span id="en3382"> Looking that way, Mr.</span><span id="en3383"> Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3384"> "Young Jerry," said Mr.</span><span id="en3385"> Cruncher, turning to his offspring, "it's a buryin'."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3386"> "Hooroar, father!"</span><span id="en3387"> cried Young Jerry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3388"> The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance.</span><span id="en3389"> The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3390"> "What d'ye mean?</span><span id="en3391"> What are you hooroaring at?</span><span id="en3392"> What do you want to conwey to your own father, you young Rip?</span><span id="en3393"> This boy is a getting too many for me!"</span><span id="en3394"> said Mr.</span><span id="en3395"> Cruncher, surveying him.</span><span id="en3396"> "Him and his hooroars!</span><span id="en3397"> Don't let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me.</span><span id="en3398"> D'ye hear?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3399"> "I warn't doing no harm," Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3400"> "Drop it then," said Mr.</span><span id="en3401"> Cruncher; "I won't have none of your no harms.</span><span id="en3402"> Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3403"> His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position.</span><span id="en3404"> The position appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and incessantly groaning and calling out: "Yah!</span><span id="en3405"> Spies!</span><span id="en3406"> Tst!</span><span id="en3407"> Yaha!</span><span id="en3408"> Spies!"</span><span id="en3409"> with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3410"> Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr.</span><span id="en3411"> Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed Tellson's.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3412"> "What is it, brother?</span><span id="en3413"> What's it about?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3414"> "I don't know," said the man.</span><span id="en3415"> "Spies!</span><span id="en3416"> Yaha!</span><span id="en3417"> Tst!</span><span id="en3418"> Spies!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3419"> He asked another man.</span><span id="en3420"> "Who is it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3421"> "I don't know," returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, "Spies!</span><span id="en3422"> Yaha!</span><span id="en3423"> Tst, tst!</span><span id="en3424"> Spi—ies!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3425"> At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3426"> "Was He a spy?"</span><span id="en3427"> asked Mr.</span><span id="en3428"> Cruncher.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3429"> "Old Bailey spy," returned his informant.</span><span id="en3430"> "Yaha!</span><span id="en3431"> Tst!</span><span id="en3432"> Yah!</span><span id="en3433"> Old Bailey Spi—i—ies!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3434"> "Why, to be sure!"</span><span id="en3435"> exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had assisted.</span><span id="en3436"> "I've seen him.</span><span id="en3437"> Dead, is he?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3438"> "Dead as mutton," returned the other, "and can't be too dead.</span><span id="en3439"> Have 'em out, there!</span><span id="en3440"> Spies!</span><span id="en3441"> Pull 'em out, there!</span><span id="en3442"> Spies!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3443"> The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop.</span><span id="en3444"> On the crowd's opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3445"> These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.</span><span id="en3446"> They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing.</span><span id="en3447"> Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it.</span><span id="en3448"> Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning coach.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3449"> The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.</span><span id="en3450"> The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse—advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the purpose—and with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach.</span><span id="en3451"> A bear-leader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3452"> Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it.</span><span id="en3453"> Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields.</span><span id="en3454"> It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3455"> The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them.</span><span id="en3456"> Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated.</span><span id="en3457"> The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy and natural.</span><span id="en3458"> At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming.</span><span id="en3459"> Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3460"> Mr.</span><span id="en3461"> Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.</span><span id="en3462"> The place had a soothing influence on him.</span><span id="en3463"> He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3464"> "Jerry," said Mr.</span><span id="en3465"> Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way, "you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he was a young 'un and a straight made 'un."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3466"> Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his station at Tellson's.</span><span id="en3467"> Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser—a distinguished surgeon—on his way back.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3468"> Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his absence.</span><span id="en3469"> The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr.</span><span id="en3470"> Cruncher and his son went home to tea.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3471"> "Now, I tell you where it is!"</span><span id="en3472"> said Mr.</span><span id="en3473"> Cruncher to his wife, on entering.</span><span id="en3474"> "If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3475"> The dejected Mrs.</span><span id="en3476"> Cruncher shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3477"> "Why, you're at it afore my face!"</span><span id="en3478"> said Mr.</span><span id="en3479"> Cruncher, with signs of angry apprehension.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3480"> "I am saying nothing."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3481"> "Well, then; don't meditate nothing.</span><span id="en3482"> You might as well flop as meditate.</span><span id="en3483"> You may as well go again me one way as another.</span><span id="en3484"> Drop it altogether."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3485"> "Yes, Jerry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3486"> "Yes, Jerry," repeated Mr.</span><span id="en3487"> Cruncher sitting down to tea.</span><span id="en3488"> "Ah!</span><span id="en3489"> It is yes, Jerry.</span><span id="en3490"> That's about it.</span><span id="en3491"> You may say yes, Jerry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3492"> Mr.</span><span id="en3493"> Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3494"> "You and your yes, Jerry," said Mr.</span><span id="en3495"> Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer.</span><span id="en3496"> "Ah!</span><span id="en3497"> I think so.</span><span id="en3498"> I believe you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3499"> "You are going out to-night?"</span><span id="en3500"> asked his decent wife, when he took another bite.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3501"> "Yes, I am."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3502"> "May I go with you, father?"</span><span id="en3503"> asked his son, briskly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3504"> "No, you mayn't.</span><span id="en3505"> I'm a going—as your mother knows—a fishing.</span><span id="en3506"> That's where I'm going to.</span><span id="en3507"> Going a fishing."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3508"> "Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3509"> "Never you mind."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3510"> "Shall you bring any fish home, father?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3511"> "If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow," returned that gentleman, shaking his head; "that's questions enough for you; I ain't a going out, till you've been long abed."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3512"> He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs.</span><span id="en3513"> Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage.</span><span id="en3514"> With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections.</span><span id="en3515"> The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife.</span><span id="en3516"> It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3517"> "And mind you!"</span><span id="en3518"> said Mr.</span><span id="en3519"> Cruncher.</span><span id="en3520"> "No games to-morrow!</span><span id="en3521"> If I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread.</span><span id="en3522"> If I, as a honest tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on water.</span><span id="en3523"> When you go to Rome, do as Rome does.</span><span id="en3524"> Rome will be a ugly customer to you, if you don't.</span><span id="en3525"> I'm your Rome, you know."</span></p>

<p><span id="en3526"> "With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink!</span><span id="en3527"> I don't know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct.</span><span id="en3528"> Look at your boy: he is your'n, ain't he?</span><span id="en3529"> He's as thin as a lath.</span><span id="en3530"> Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3531"> This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3532"> Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions, obeyed them.</span><span id="en3533"> Mr.</span><span id="en3534"> Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o'clock.</span><span id="en3535"> Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature.</span><span id="en3536"> Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs.</span><span id="en3537"> Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3538"> Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed, was not long after his father.</span><span id="en3539"> Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out into the streets.</span><span id="en3540"> He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door stood ajar all night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3541"> Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in view.</span><span id="en3542"> The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3543"> Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road.</span><span id="en3544"> Another fisherman was picked up here—and that so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split himself into two.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3545"> The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road.</span><span id="en3546"> Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing.</span><span id="en3547"> In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall—there, risen to some eight or ten feet high—formed one side.</span><span id="en3548"> Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.</span><span id="en3549"> He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third.</span><span id="en3550"> They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little—listening perhaps.</span><span id="en3551"> Then, they moved away on their hands and knees.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3552"> It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did, holding his breath.</span><span id="en3553"> Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!</span><span id="en3554"> and all the gravestones in the churchyard—it was a large churchyard that they were in—looking on like ghosts in white, while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant.</span><span id="en3555"> They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright.</span><span id="en3556"> And then they began to fish.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3557"> They fished with a spade, at first.</span><span id="en3558"> Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.</span><span id="en3559"> Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his father's.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3560"> But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again.</span><span id="en3561"> They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite.</span><span id="en3562"> There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were strained, as if by a weight.</span><span id="en3563"> By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it, and came to the surface.</span><span id="en3564"> Young Jerry very well knew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3565"> He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of.</span><span id="en3566"> He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side—perhaps taking his arm—it was a pursuer to shun.</span><span id="en3567"> It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy's Kite without tail and wings.</span><span id="en3568"> It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing.</span><span id="en3569"> It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up.</span><span id="en3570"> All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead.</span><span id="en3571"> And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3572"> From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room.</span><span id="en3573"> Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs.</span><span id="en3574"> Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3575"> "I told you I would," said Mr.</span><span id="en3576"> Cruncher, "and I did."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3577"> "Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!"</span><span id="en3578"> his wife implored.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3579"> "You oppose yourself to the profit of the business," said Jerry, "and me and my partners suffer.</span><span id="en3580"> You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3581"> "I try to be a good wife, Jerry," the poor woman protested, with tears.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3582"> "Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business?</span><span id="en3583"> Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?</span><span id="en3584"> Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3585"> "You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3586"> "It's enough for you," retorted Mr.</span><span id="en3587"> Cruncher, "to be the wife of a honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn't.</span><span id="en3588"> A honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether.</span><span id="en3589"> Call yourself a religious woman?</span><span id="en3590"> If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one!</span><span id="en3591"> You have no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3592"> The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down at his length on the floor.</span><span id="en3593"> After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay down too, and fell asleep again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3594"> There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else.</span><span id="en3595"> Mr.</span><span id="en3596"> Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs.</span><span id="en3597"> Cruncher, in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace.</span><span id="en3598"> He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3599"> Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer.</span><span id="en3600"> His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night—in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3601"> "Father," said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: "what's a Resurrection-Man?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3602"> Mr.</span><span id="en3603"> Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, "How should I know?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3604"> "I thought you knowed everything, father," said the artless boy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3605"> "Hem!</span><span id="en3606"> Well," returned Mr.</span><span id="en3607"> Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, "he's a tradesman."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3608"> "What's his goods, father?"</span><span id="en3609"> asked the brisk Young Jerry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3610"> "His goods," said Mr.</span><span id="en3611"> Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, "is a branch of Scientific goods."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3612"> "Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?"</span><span id="en3613"> asked the lively boy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3614"> "I believe it is something of that sort," said Mr.</span><span id="en3615"> Cruncher.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3616"> "Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3617"> Mr.</span><span id="en3618"> Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.</span><span id="en3619"> "It depends upon how you dewelop your talents.</span><span id="en3620"> Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for."</span><span id="en3621"> As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr.</span><span id="en3622"> Cruncher added to himself: "Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!"</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-6_htm_html_pgepubid00024">XV. Knitting</h2>
<p><span id="en3623"> There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge.</span><span id="en3624"> As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine.</span><span id="en3625"> Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time.</span><span id="en3626"> A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy.</span><span id="en3627"> No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3628"> This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge.</span><span id="en3629"> It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come.</span><span id="en3630"> There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls.</span><span id="en3631"> These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3632"> Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible.</span><span id="en3633"> He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3634"> A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol.</span><span id="en3635"> Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3636"> Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday.</span><span id="en3637"> It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap.</span><span id="en3638"> All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop.</span><span id="en3639"> Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows.</span><span id="en3640"> Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3641"> "Good day, gentlemen!"</span><span id="en3642"> said Monsieur Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3643"> It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue.</span><span id="en3644"> It elicited an answering chorus of "Good day!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3645"> "It is bad weather, gentlemen," said Defarge, shaking his head.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3646"> Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent.</span><span id="en3647"> Except one man, who got up and went out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3648"> "My wife," said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: "I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques.</span><span id="en3649"> I met him—by accident—a day and half's journey out of Paris.</span><span id="en3650"> He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques.</span><span id="en3651"> Give him to drink, my wife!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3652"> A second man got up and went out.</span><span id="en3653"> Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank.</span><span id="en3654"> In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge's counter.</span><span id="en3655"> A third man got up and went out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3656"> Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine—but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity—and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.</span><span id="en3657"> He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3658"> "Have you finished your repast, friend?"</span><span id="en3659"> he asked, in due season.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3660"> "Yes, thank you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3661"> "Come, then!</span><span id="en3662"> You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy.</span><span id="en3663"> It will suit you to a marvel."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3664"> Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret—formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3665"> No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly.</span><span id="en3666"> And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.</span></p>

<p><span id="en3667"> "Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three!</span><span id="en3668"> This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four.</span><span id="en3669"> He will tell you all.</span><span id="en3670"> Speak, Jacques Five!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3671"> The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, "Where shall I commence, monsieur?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3672"> "Commence," was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, "at the commencement."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3673"> "I saw him then, messieurs," began the mender of roads, "a year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain.</span><span id="en3674"> Behold the manner of it.</span><span id="en3675"> I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain—like this."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3676"> Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3677"> Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?</span></p>
<p><span id="en3678"> "Never," answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3679"> Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?</span></p>
<p><span id="en3680"> "By his tall figure," said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose.</span><span id="en3681"> "When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, 'Say, what is he like?</span><span id="en3682"> ' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3683"> "You should have said, short as a dwarf," returned Jacques Two.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3684"> "But what did I know?</span><span id="en3685"> The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me.</span><span id="en3686"> Observe!</span><span id="en3687"> Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony.</span><span id="en3688"> Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me!</span><span id="en3689"> Bring that rascal!</span><span id="en3690"> ' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3691"> "He is right there, Jacques," murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted.</span><span id="en3692"> "Go on!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3693"> "Good!"</span><span id="en3694"> said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery.</span><span id="en3695"> "The tall man is lost, and he is sought—how many months?</span><span id="en3696"> Nine, ten, eleven?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3697"> "No matter, the number," said Defarge.</span><span id="en3698"> "He is well hidden, but at last he is unluckily found.</span><span id="en3699"> Go on!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3700"> "I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to go to bed.</span><span id="en3701"> I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers.</span><span id="en3702"> In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound—tied to his sides—like this!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3703"> With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3704"> "I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight—except on the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs.</span><span id="en3705"> Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.</span><span id="en3706"> Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp!</span><span id="en3707"> But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me.</span><span id="en3708"> Ah, but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3709"> He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3710"> "I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with our eyes.</span><span id="en3711"> 'Come on!</span><span id="en3712"> ' says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, 'bring him fast to his tomb!</span><span id="en3713"> ' and they bring him faster.</span><span id="en3714"> I follow.</span><span id="en3715"> His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame.</span><span id="en3716"> Because he is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him with their guns—like this!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3717"> He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3718"> "As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls.</span><span id="en3719"> They laugh and pick him up again.</span><span id="en3720"> His face is bleeding and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again.</span><span id="en3721"> They bring him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow him—like this!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3722"> He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth.</span><span id="en3723"> Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, Defarge said, "Go on, Jacques."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3724"> "All the village," pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low voice, "withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it, except to perish.</span><span id="en3725"> In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work.</span><span id="en3726"> There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through.</span><span id="en3727"> He has no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a dead man."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3728"> Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another.</span><span id="en3729"> The looks of all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was authoritative too.</span><span id="en3730"> They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3731"> "Go on, Jacques," said Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3732"> "He remains up there in his iron cage some days.</span><span id="en3733"> The village looks at him by stealth, for it is afraid.</span><span id="en3734"> But it always looks up, from a distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned towards the prison.</span><span id="en3735"> Formerly, they were turned towards the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison.</span><span id="en3736"> They whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself.</span><span id="en3737"> What do I know?</span><span id="en3738"> It is possible.</span><span id="en3739"> Perhaps yes, perhaps no."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3740"> "Listen then, Jacques," Number One of that name sternly interposed.</span><span id="en3741"> "Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen.</span><span id="en3742"> All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen.</span><span id="en3743"> It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his hand."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3744"> "And once again listen, Jacques!"</span><span id="en3745"> said the kneeling Number Three: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something—that was neither food nor drink; "the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows.</span><span id="en3746"> You hear?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3747"> "I hear, messieurs."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3748"> "Go on then," said Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3749"> "Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain," resumed the countryman, "that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed.</span><span id="en3750"> They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants—serfs—what you will—he will be executed as a parricide.</span><span id="en3751"> One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses.</span><span id="en3752"> That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen.</span><span id="en3753"> But how do I know if he lies?</span><span id="en3754"> I am not a scholar."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3755"> "Listen once again then, Jacques!"</span><span id="en3756"> said the man with the restless hand and the craving air.</span><span id="en3757"> "The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last—to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed!</span><span id="en3758"> And it was done—why, how old are you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3759"> "Thirty-five," said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3760"> "It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3761"> "Enough!"</span><span id="en3762"> said Defarge, with grim impatience.</span><span id="en3763"> "Long live the Devil!</span><span id="en3764"> Go on."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3765"> "Well!</span><span id="en3766"> Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune.</span><span id="en3767"> At length, on Sunday night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.</span><span id="en3768"> Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3769"> The mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling, and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3770"> "All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out, the cows are there with the rest.</span><span id="en3771"> At midday, the roll of drums.</span><span id="en3772"> Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many soldiers.</span><span id="en3773"> He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag—tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed."</span><span id="en3774"> He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners of his mouth to his ears.</span><span id="en3775"> "On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air.</span><span id="en3776"> He is hanged there forty feet high—and is left hanging, poisoning the water."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3777"> They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3778"> "It is frightful, messieurs.</span><span id="en3779"> How can the women and the children draw water!</span><span id="en3780"> Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow!</span><span id="en3781"> Under it, have I said?</span><span id="en3782"> When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prison—seemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3783"> The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3784"> "That's all, messieurs.</span><span id="en3785"> I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do), and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was warned I should) this comrade.</span><span id="en3786"> With him, I came on, now riding and now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night.</span><span id="en3787"> And here you see me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3788"> After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, "Good!</span><span id="en3789"> You have acted and recounted faithfully.</span><span id="en3790"> Will you wait for us a little, outside the door?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3791"> "Very willingly," said the mender of roads.</span><span id="en3792"> Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3793"> The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to the garret.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3794"> "How say you, Jacques?"</span><span id="en3795"> demanded Number One.</span><span id="en3796"> "To be registered?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3797"> "To be registered, as doomed to destruction," returned Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3798"> "Magnificent!"</span><span id="en3799"> croaked the man with the craving.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3800"> "The chateau, and all the race?"</span><span id="en3801"> inquired the first.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3802"> "The chateau and all the race," returned Defarge.</span><span id="en3803"> "Extermination."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3804"> The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, "Magnificent!"</span><span id="en3805"> and began gnawing another finger.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3806"> "Are you sure," asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, "that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register?</span><span id="en3807"> Without doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always be able to decipher it—or, I ought to say, will she?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3808"> "Jacques," returned Defarge, drawing himself up, "if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose a word of it—not a syllable of it.</span><span id="en3809"> Knitted, in her own stitches and her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun.</span><span id="en3810"> Confide in Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en3811"> It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives, to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3812"> There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who hungered, asked: "Is this rustic to be sent back soon?</span><span id="en3813"> I hope so.</span><span id="en3814"> He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3815"> "He knows nothing," said Defarge; "at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height.</span><span id="en3816"> I charge myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him on his road.</span><span id="en3817"> He wishes to see the fine world—the King, the Queen, and Court; let him see them on Sunday."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3818"> "What?"</span><span id="en3819"> exclaimed the hungry man, staring.</span><span id="en3820"> "Is it a good sign, that he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3821"> "Jacques," said Defarge; "judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her to thirst for it.</span><span id="en3822"> Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish him to bring it down one day."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3823"> Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest.</span><span id="en3824"> He needed no persuasion, and was soon asleep.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3825"> Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree.</span><span id="en3826"> Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very new and agreeable.</span><span id="en3827"> But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her.</span><span id="en3828"> For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3829"> Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles.</span><span id="en3830"> It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3831"> "You work hard, madame," said a man near her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3832"> "Yes," answered Madame Defarge; "I have a good deal to do."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3833"> "What do you make, madame?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3834"> "Many things."</span></p>

<p><span id="en3835"> "For instance," returned Madame Defarge, composedly, "shrouds."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3836"> The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive.</span><span id="en3837"> If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything!</span><span id="en3838"> as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time.</span><span id="en3839"> Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye, more lords and ladies, more Long live they all!</span><span id="en3840"> until he absolutely wept with sentiment.</span><span id="en3841"> During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3842"> "Bravo!"</span><span id="en3843"> said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a patron; "you are a good boy!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3844"> The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3845"> "You are the fellow we want," said Defarge, in his ear; "you make these fools believe that it will last for ever.</span><span id="en3846"> Then, they are the more insolent, and it is the nearer ended."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3847"> "Hey!"</span><span id="en3848"> cried the mender of roads, reflectively; "that's true."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3849"> "These fools know nothing.</span><span id="en3850"> While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them.</span><span id="en3851"> Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3852"> Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3853"> "As to you," said she, "you would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise.</span><span id="en3854"> Say!</span><span id="en3855"> Would you not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3856"> "Truly, madame, I think so.</span><span id="en3857"> For the moment."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3858"> "If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest.</span><span id="en3859"> Say!</span><span id="en3860"> Would you not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3861"> "Truly yes, madame."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3862"> "Yes.</span><span id="en3863"> And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3864"> "It is true, madame."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3865"> "You have seen both dolls and birds to-day," said Madame Defarge, with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; "now, go home!"</span></p>

<p><span id="en3866"> Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the whispering trees.</span><span id="en3867"> Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered.</span><span id="en3868"> A rumour just lived in the village—had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had—that when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever.</span><span id="en3869"> In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3870"> Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the stone floor, and the pure water in the village well—thousands of acres of land—a whole province of France—all France itself—lay under the night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line.</span><span id="en3871"> So does a whole world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star.</span><span id="en3872"> And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3873"> The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight, in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended.</span><span id="en3874"> There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry.</span><span id="en3875"> Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the soldiery there, and one of the police.</span><span id="en3876"> The latter he was intimate with, and affectionately embraced.</span></p>

<p><span id="en3877"> "Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3878"> "Very little to-night, but all he knows.</span><span id="en3879"> There is another spy commissioned for our quarter.</span><span id="en3880"> There may be many more, for all that he can say, but he knows of one."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3881"> "Eh well!"</span><span id="en3882"> said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool business air.</span><span id="en3883"> "It is necessary to register him.</span><span id="en3884"> How do they call that man?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3885"> "He is English."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3886"> "So much the better.</span><span id="en3887"> His name?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3888"> "Barsad," said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation.</span><span id="en3889"> But, he had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect correctness.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3890"> "Barsad," repeated madame.</span><span id="en3891"> "Good.</span><span id="en3892"> Christian name?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3893"> "John."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3894"> "John Barsad," repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.</span><span id="en3895"> "Good.</span><span id="en3896"> His appearance; is it known?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3897"> "Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3898"> "Eh my faith.</span><span id="en3899"> It is a portrait!"</span><span id="en3900"> said madame, laughing.</span><span id="en3901"> "He shall be registered to-morrow."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3902"> They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight), and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally dismissed him to bed.</span><span id="en3903"> Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the night.</span><span id="en3904"> All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he walked up and down through life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3905"> The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling.</span><span id="en3906"> Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed.</span><span id="en3907"> He whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3908"> "You are fatigued," said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the money.</span><span id="en3909"> "There are only the usual odours."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3910"> "I am a little tired," her husband acknowledged.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3911"> "You are a little depressed, too," said madame, whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for him.</span><span id="en3912"> "Oh, the men, the men!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3913"> "But my dear!"</span><span id="en3914"> began Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3915"> "But my dear!"</span><span id="en3916"> repeated madame, nodding firmly; "but my dear!</span><span id="en3917"> You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3918"> "Well, then," said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his breast, "it is a long time."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3919"> "It is a long time," repeated his wife; "and when is it not a long time?</span><span id="en3920"> Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3921"> "It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning," said Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3922"> "How long," demanded madame, composedly, "does it take to make and store the lightning?</span><span id="en3923"> Tell me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3924"> Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that too.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3925"> "It does not take a long time," said madame, "for an earthquake to swallow a town.</span><span id="en3926"> Eh well!</span><span id="en3927"> Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3928"> "A long time, I suppose," said Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3929"> "But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything before it.</span><span id="en3930"> In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen or heard.</span><span id="en3931"> That is your consolation.</span><span id="en3932"> Keep it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3933"> She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3934"> "I tell thee," said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, "that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming.</span><span id="en3935"> I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops.</span><span id="en3936"> I tell thee it is always advancing.</span><span id="en3937"> Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour.</span><span id="en3938"> Can such things last?</span><span id="en3939"> Bah!</span><span id="en3940"> I mock you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3941"> "My brave wife," returned Defarge, standing before her with his head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist, "I do not question all this.</span><span id="en3942"> But it has lasted a long time, and it is possible—you know well, my wife, it is possible—that it may not come, during our lives."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3943"> "Eh well!</span><span id="en3944"> How then?"</span><span id="en3945"> demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there were another enemy strangled.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3946"> "Well!"</span><span id="en3947"> said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.</span><span id="en3948"> "We shall not see the triumph."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3949"> "We shall have helped it," returned madame, with her extended hand in strong action.</span><span id="en3950"> "Nothing that we do, is done in vain.</span><span id="en3951"> I believe, with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3952"> Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3953"> "Hold!"</span><span id="en3954"> cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice; "I too, my dear, will stop at nothing."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3955"> "Yes!</span><span id="en3956"> But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity, to sustain you.</span><span id="en3957"> Sustain yourself without that.</span><span id="en3958"> When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained—not shown—yet always ready."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3959"> Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3960"> Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine-shop, knitting away assiduously.</span><span id="en3961"> A rose lay beside her, and if she now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air.</span><span id="en3962"> There were a few customers, drinking or not drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about.</span><span id="en3963"> The day was very hot, and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead at the bottom.</span><span id="en3964"> Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met the same fate.</span><span id="en3965"> Curious to consider how heedless flies are!</span><span id="en3966"> —perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3967"> A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one.</span><span id="en3968"> She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3969"> It was curious.</span><span id="en3970"> The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3971"> "Good day, madame," said the new-comer.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3972"> "Good day, monsieur."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3973"> She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting: "Hah!</span><span id="en3974"> Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression!</span><span id="en3975"> Good day, one and all!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3976"> "Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3977"> Madame complied with a polite air.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3978"> "Marvellous cognac this, madame!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3979"> It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better.</span><span id="en3980"> She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting.</span><span id="en3981"> The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3982"> "You knit with great skill, madame."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3983"> "I am accustomed to it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en3984"> "A pretty pattern too!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3985"> "You think so?"</span><span id="en3986"> said madame, looking at him with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3987"> "Decidedly.</span><span id="en3988"> May one ask what it is for?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3989"> "Pastime," said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en3990"> "Not for use?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3991"> "That depends.</span><span id="en3992"> I may find a use for it one day.</span><span id="en3993"> If I do—Well," said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, "I'll use it!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en3994"> It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en3995"> Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.</span><span id="en3996"> Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left.</span><span id="en3997"> They had all dropped off.</span><span id="en3998"> The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign.</span><span id="en3999"> They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4000"> "John," thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger.</span><span id="en4001"> "Stay long enough, and I shall knit 'BARSAD' before you go."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4002"> "You have a husband, madame?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4003"> "I have."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4004"> "Children?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4005"> "No children."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4006"> "Business seems bad?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4007"> "Business is very bad; the people are so poor."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4008"> "Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people!</span><span id="en4009"> So oppressed, too—as you say."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4010"> "As you say," madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4011"> "Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.</span><span id="en4012"> Of course."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4013"> "I think?"</span><span id="en4014"> returned madame, in a high voice.</span><span id="en4015"> "I and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking.</span><span id="en4016"> All we think, here, is how to live.</span><span id="en4017"> That is the subject we think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others.</span><span id="en4018"> I think for others?</span><span id="en4019"> No, no."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4020"> The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4021"> "A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution.</span><span id="en4022"> Ah!</span><span id="en4023"> the poor Gaspard!"</span><span id="en4024"> With a sigh of great compassion.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4025"> "My faith!"</span><span id="en4026"> returned madame, coolly and lightly, "if people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it.</span><span id="en4027"> He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4028"> "I believe," said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: "I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow?</span><span id="en4029"> Between ourselves."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4030"> "Is there?"</span><span id="en4031"> asked madame, vacantly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4032"> "Is there not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4033"> "—Here is my husband!"</span><span id="en4034"> said Madame Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4035"> As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, "Good day, Jacques!"</span><span id="en4036"> Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4037"> "Good day, Jacques!"</span><span id="en4038"> the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4039"> "You deceive yourself, monsieur," returned the keeper of the wine-shop.</span><span id="en4040"> "You mistake me for another.</span><span id="en4041"> That is not my name.</span><span id="en4042"> I am Ernest Defarge."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4043"> "It is all the same," said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: "good day!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4044"> "Good day!"</span><span id="en4045"> answered Defarge, drily.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4046"> "I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is—and no wonder!</span><span id="en4047"> —much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4048"> "No one has told me so," said Defarge, shaking his head.</span><span id="en4049"> "I know nothing of it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4050"> Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4051"> The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac.</span><span id="en4052"> Madame Defarge poured it out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4053"> "You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?"</span><span id="en4054"> observed Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4055"> "Not at all, but I hope to know it better.</span><span id="en4056"> I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4057"> "Hah!"</span><span id="en4058"> muttered Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4059"> "The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me," pursued the spy, "that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4060"> "Indeed!"</span><span id="en4061"> said Defarge, with much indifference.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4062"> "Yes, indeed.</span><span id="en4063"> When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know.</span><span id="en4064"> He was delivered to you.</span><span id="en4065"> You see I am informed of the circumstances?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4066"> "Such is the fact, certainly," said Defarge.</span><span id="en4067"> He had had it conveyed to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4068"> "It was to you," said the spy, "that his daughter came; and it was from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown monsieur; how is he called?</span><span id="en4069"> —in a little wig—Lorry—of the bank of Tellson and Company—over to England."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4070"> "Such is the fact," repeated Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4071"> "Very interesting remembrances!"</span><span id="en4072"> said the spy.</span><span id="en4073"> "I have known Doctor Manette and his daughter, in England."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4074"> "Yes?"</span><span id="en4075"> said Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4076"> "You don't hear much about them now?"</span><span id="en4077"> said the spy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4078"> "No," said Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4079"> "In effect," madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little song, "we never hear about them.</span><span id="en4080"> We received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have gradually taken their road in life—we, ours—and we have held no correspondence."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4081"> "Perfectly so, madame," replied the spy.</span><span id="en4082"> "She is going to be married."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4083"> "Going?"</span><span id="en4084"> echoed madame.</span><span id="en4085"> "She was pretty enough to have been married long ago.</span><span id="en4086"> You English are cold, it seems to me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4087"> "Oh!</span><span id="en4088"> You know I am English."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4089"> "I perceive your tongue is," returned madame; "and what the tongue is, I suppose the man is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4090"> He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4091"> "Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married.</span><span id="en4092"> But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth.</span><span id="en4093"> And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard!</span><span id="en4094"> It was cruel, cruel!</span><span id="en4095"> ), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis.</span><span id="en4096"> But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr.</span><span id="en4097"> Charles Darnay.</span><span id="en4098"> D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4099"> Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband.</span><span id="en4100"> Do what he would, behind the little counter, as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy.</span><span id="en4101"> The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4102"> Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr.</span><span id="en4103"> Barsad paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again.</span><span id="en4104"> For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should come back.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4105"> "Can it be true," said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: "what he has said of Ma'amselle Manette?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4106"> "As he has said it," returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, "it is probably false.</span><span id="en4107"> But it may be true."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4108"> "If it is—" Defarge began, and stopped.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4109"> "If it is?"</span><span id="en4110"> repeated his wife.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4111"> "—And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph—I hope, for her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4112"> "Her husband's destiny," said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure, "will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is to end him.</span><span id="en4113"> That is all I know."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4114"> "But it is very strange—now, at least, is it not very strange"—said Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it, "that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4115"> "Stranger things than that will happen when it does come," answered madame.</span><span id="en4116"> "I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here for their merits; that is enough."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4117"> She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.</span><span id="en4118"> Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4119"> In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group: a Missionary—there were many like her—such as the world will do well never to breed again.</span><span id="en4120"> All the women knitted.</span><span id="en4121"> They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still, the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4122"> But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts.</span><span id="en4123"> And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left behind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4124"> Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration.</span><span id="en4125"> "A great woman," said he, "a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully grand woman!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4126"> Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as the women sat knitting, knitting.</span><span id="en4127"> Darkness encompassed them.</span><span id="en4128"> Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty, Freedom and Life.</span><span id="en4129"> So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting, counting dropping heads.</span></p>

<p><span id="en4130"> Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together.</span><span id="en4131"> Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4132"> Lucie was to be married to-morrow.</span><span id="en4133"> She had reserved this last evening for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4134"> "You are happy, my dear father?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4135"> "Quite, my child."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4136"> They had said little, though they had been there a long time.</span><span id="en4137"> When it was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself in her usual work, nor had she read to him.</span><span id="en4138"> She had employed herself in both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4139"> "And I am very happy to-night, dear father.</span><span id="en4140"> I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessed—my love for Charles, and Charles's love for me.</span><span id="en4141"> But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4142"> Even as it was, she could not command her voice.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4143"> In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face upon his breast.</span><span id="en4144"> In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of the sun itself is—as the light called human life is—at its coming and its going.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4145"> "Dearest dear!</span><span id="en4146"> Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us?</span><span id="en4147"> I know it well, but do you know it?</span><span id="en4148"> In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4149"> Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, "Quite sure, my darling!</span><span id="en4150"> More than that," he added, as he tenderly kissed her: "my future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been—nay, than it ever was—without it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4151"> "If I could hope that, my father!</span></p>
<p><span id="en4152"> "Believe it, love!</span><span id="en4153"> Indeed it is so.</span><span id="en4154"> Consider how natural and how plain it is, my dear, that it should be so.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4155"> She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4156"> "—wasted, my child—should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things—for my sake.</span><span id="en4157"> Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4158"> "If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy with you."</span></p>

<p><span id="en4159"> "My child, you did see him, and it is Charles.</span><span id="en4160"> If it had not been Charles, it would have been another.</span><span id="en4161"> Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4162"> It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering.</span><span id="en4163"> It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4164"> "See!"</span><span id="en4165"> said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.</span><span id="en4166"> "I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her light.</span><span id="en4167"> I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls.</span><span id="en4168"> I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them."</span><span id="en4169"> He added in his inward and pondering manner, as he looked at the moon, "It was twenty either way, I remember, and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4170"> The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time, deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference.</span><span id="en4171"> He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4172"> "I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent.</span><span id="en4173"> Whether it was alive.</span><span id="en4174"> Whether it had been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it.</span><span id="en4175"> Whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father.</span><span id="en4176"> (There was a time in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.</span><span id="en4177"> ) Whether it was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own will and act.</span><span id="en4178"> Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4179"> She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4180"> "I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of me—rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me.</span><span id="en4181"> I have cast up the years of her age, year after year.</span><span id="en4182"> I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate.</span><span id="en4183"> I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a blank."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4184"> "My father!</span><span id="en4185"> Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4186"> "You, Lucie?</span><span id="en4187"> It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and the moon on this last night.</span><span id="en4188"> —What did I say just now?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4189"> "She knew nothing of you.</span><span id="en4190"> She cared nothing for you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4191"> "So!</span><span id="en4192"> But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way—have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could—I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress.</span><span id="en4193"> I have seen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.</span><span id="en4194"> But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4195"> "The figure was not; the—the—image; the fancy?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4196"> "No.</span><span id="en4197"> That was another thing.</span><span id="en4198"> It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved.</span><span id="en4199"> The phantom that my mind pursued, was another and more real child.</span><span id="en4200"> Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother.</span><span id="en4201"> The other had that likeness too—as you have—but was not the same.</span><span id="en4202"> Can you follow me, Lucie?</span><span id="en4203"> Hardly, I think?</span><span id="en4204"> I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4205"> His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4206"> "In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight, coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father.</span><span id="en4207"> My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers.</span><span id="en4208"> Her life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4209"> "I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love that was I."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4210"> "And she showed me her children," said the Doctor of Beauvais, "and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me.</span><span id="en4211"> When they passed a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers.</span><span id="en4212"> She could never deliver me; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.</span><span id="en4213"> But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and blessed her."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4214"> "I am that child, I hope, my father.</span><span id="en4215"> O my dear, my dear, will you bless me as fervently to-morrow?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4216"> "Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great happiness.</span><span id="en4217"> My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4218"> He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him.</span><span id="en4219"> By-and-bye, they went into the house.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4220"> There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr.</span><span id="en4221"> Lorry; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross.</span><span id="en4222"> The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4223"> Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper.</span><span id="en4224"> They were only three at table, and Miss Pross made the third.</span><span id="en4225"> He regretted that Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4226"> So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.</span><span id="en4227"> But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears, beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4228"> All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet.</span><span id="en4229"> She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his; then, leaned over him, and looked at him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4230"> Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep.</span><span id="en4231"> A more remarkable face in its quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4232"> She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his sorrows deserved.</span><span id="en4233"> Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once more, and went away.</span><span id="en4234"> So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-7_htm_html_pgepubid00027">XVIII. Nine Days</h2>
<p><span id="en4235"> The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay.</span><span id="en4236"> They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.</span><span id="en4237"> Lorry, and Miss Pross—to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4238"> "And so," said Mr.</span><span id="en4239"> Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; "and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the Channel, such a baby!</span><span id="en4240"> Lord bless me!</span><span id="en4241"> How little I thought what I was doing!</span><span id="en4242"> How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend Mr.</span><span id="en4243"> Charles!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4244"> "You didn't mean it," remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, "and therefore how could you know it?</span><span id="en4245"> Nonsense!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4246"> "Really?</span><span id="en4247"> Well; but don't cry," said the gentle Mr.</span><span id="en4248"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4249"> "I am not crying," said Miss Pross; "you are."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4250"> "I, my Pross?"</span><span id="en4251"> (By this time, Mr.</span><span id="en4252"> Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4253"> "You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it.</span><span id="en4254"> Such a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes.</span><span id="en4255"> There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection," said Miss Pross, "that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldn't see it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4256"> "I am highly gratified," said Mr.</span><span id="en4257"> Lorry, "though, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one.</span><span id="en4258"> Dear me!</span><span id="en4259"> This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost.</span><span id="en4260"> Dear, dear, dear!</span><span id="en4261"> To think that there might have been a Mrs.</span><span id="en4262"> Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4263"> "Not at all!"</span><span id="en4264"> From Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4265"> "You think there never might have been a Mrs.</span><span id="en4266"> Lorry?"</span><span id="en4267"> asked the gentleman of that name.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4268"> "Pooh!"</span><span id="en4269"> rejoined Miss Pross; "you were a bachelor in your cradle."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4270"> "Well!"</span><span id="en4271"> observed Mr.</span><span id="en4272"> Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, "that seems probable, too."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4273"> "And you were cut out for a bachelor," pursued Miss Pross, "before you were put in your cradle."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4274"> "Then, I think," said Mr.</span><span id="en4275"> Lorry, "that I was very unhandsomely dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern.</span><span id="en4276"> Enough!</span><span id="en4277"> Now, my dear Lucie," drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, "I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear.</span><span id="en4278"> You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him.</span><span id="en4279"> And when, at the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame.</span><span id="en4280"> Now, I hear Somebody's step coming to the door.</span><span id="en4281"> Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4282"> For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4283"> The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay.</span><span id="en4284"> He was so deadly pale—which had not been the case when they went in together—that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.</span><span id="en4285"> But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr.</span><span id="en4286"> Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4287"> He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr.</span><span id="en4288"> Lorry had hired in honour of the day.</span><span id="en4289"> The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4290"> Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr.</span><span id="en4291"> Lorry's pockets.</span><span id="en4292"> They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4293"> It was a hard parting, though it was not for long.</span><span id="en4294"> But her father cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, "Take her, Charles!</span><span id="en4295"> She is yours!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4296"> And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4297"> The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr.</span><span id="en4298"> Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone.</span><span id="en4299"> It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr.</span><span id="en4300"> Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4301"> He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone.</span><span id="en4302"> But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr.</span><span id="en4303"> Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr.</span><span id="en4304"> Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4305"> "I think," he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, "I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.</span><span id="en4306"> I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back presently.</span><span id="en4307"> Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4308"> It was easier for Mr.</span><span id="en4309"> Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of Tellson's.</span><span id="en4310"> He was detained two hours.</span><span id="en4311"> When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4312"> "Good God!"</span><span id="en4313"> he said, with a start.</span><span id="en4314"> "What's that?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4315"> Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear.</span><span id="en4316"> "O me, O me!</span><span id="en4317"> All is lost!"</span><span id="en4318"> cried she, wringing her hands.</span><span id="en4319"> "What is to be told to Ladybird?</span><span id="en4320"> He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4321"> Mr.</span><span id="en4322"> Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor's room.</span><span id="en4323"> The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4324"> "Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en4325"> My dear friend, Doctor Manette!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4326"> The Doctor looked at him for a moment—half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to—and bent over his work again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4327"> He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him.</span><span id="en4328"> He worked hard—impatiently—as if in some sense of having been interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4329"> Mr.</span><span id="en4330"> Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape.</span><span id="en4331"> He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4332"> "A young lady's walking shoe," he muttered, without looking up.</span><span id="en4333"> "It ought to have been finished long ago.</span><span id="en4334"> Let it be."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4335"> "But, Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en4336"> Look at me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4337"> He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4338"> "You know me, my dear friend?</span><span id="en4339"> Think again.</span><span id="en4340"> This is not your proper occupation.</span><span id="en4341"> Think, dear friend!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4342"> Nothing would induce him to speak more.</span><span id="en4343"> He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him.</span><span id="en4344"> He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air.</span><span id="en4345"> The only ray of hope that Mr.</span><span id="en4346"> Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked.</span><span id="en4347"> In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity—as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4348"> Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr.</span><span id="en4349"> Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him.</span><span id="en4350"> In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a few days of complete rest.</span><span id="en4351"> In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4352"> These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr.</span><span id="en4353"> Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself.</span><span id="en4354"> If that should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the best, on the Doctor's case.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4355"> In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr.</span><span id="en4356"> Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so.</span><span id="en4357"> He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same room.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4358"> He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried.</span><span id="en4359"> He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen, or was falling.</span><span id="en4360"> He remained, therefore, in his seat near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4361"> Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see—worked on, half an hour after Mr.</span><span id="en4362"> Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.</span><span id="en4363"> When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4364"> "Will you go out?"</span></p>

<p><span id="en4365"> "Out?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4366"> "Yes; for a walk with me.</span><span id="en4367"> Why not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4368"> He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more.</span><span id="en4369"> But, Mr.</span><span id="en4370"> Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in some misty way asking himself, "Why not?"</span><span id="en4371"> The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4372"> Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room.</span><span id="en4373"> He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep.</span><span id="en4374"> In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4375"> On this second day, Mr.</span><span id="en4376"> Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name, and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them.</span><span id="en4377"> He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly.</span><span id="en4378"> This encouraged Mr.</span><span id="en4379"> Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss.</span><span id="en4380"> This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr.</span><span id="en4381"> Lorry's friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4382"> When it fell dark again, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4383"> "Dear Doctor, will you go out?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4384"> As before, he repeated, "Out?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4385"> "Yes; for a walk with me.</span><span id="en4386"> Why not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4387"> This time, Mr.</span><span id="en4388"> Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned.</span><span id="en4389"> In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr.</span><span id="en4390"> Lorry's return, he slipped away to his bench.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4391"> The time went very slowly on, and Mr.</span><span id="en4392"> Lorry's hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.</span><span id="en4393"> The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth.</span><span id="en4394"> Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4395"> With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr.</span><span id="en4396"> Lorry passed through this anxious time.</span><span id="en4397"> The secret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-8_htm_html_pgepubid00028">XIX. An Opinion</h2>
<p><span id="en4398"> Worn out by anxious watching, Mr.</span><span id="en4399"> Lorry fell asleep at his post.</span><span id="en4400"> On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4401"> He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had done so, whether he was not still asleep.</span><span id="en4402"> For, going to the door of the Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window.</span><span id="en4403"> He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which Mr.</span><span id="en4404"> Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4405"> Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr.</span><span id="en4406"> Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?</span></p>
<p><span id="en4407"> It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious.</span><span id="en4408"> If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?</span><span id="en4409"> How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?</span></p>
<p><span id="en4410"> Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side.</span><span id="en4411"> If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.</span><span id="en4412"> He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred.</span><span id="en4413"> If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.</span><span id="en4414"> Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4415"> Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked out with care.</span><span id="en4416"> Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, Mr.</span><span id="en4417"> Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg.</span><span id="en4418"> The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4419"> So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr.</span><span id="en4420"> Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken place yesterday.</span><span id="en4421"> An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy.</span><span id="en4422"> In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr.</span><span id="en4423"> Lorry determined to have the aid he sought.</span><span id="en4424"> And that aid was his own.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4425"> Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the Doctor were left together, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4426"> "My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4427"> Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively.</span><span id="en4428"> He had already glanced at his hands more than once.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4429"> "Doctor Manette," said Mr.</span><span id="en4430"> Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, "the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine.</span><span id="en4431"> Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake—and above all, for his daughter's—his daughter's, my dear Manette."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4432"> "If I understand," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, "some mental shock—?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4433"> "Yes!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4434"> "Be explicit," said the Doctor.</span><span id="en4435"> "Spare no detail."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4436"> Mr.</span><span id="en4437"> Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4438"> "My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the—the—as you express it—the mind.</span><span id="en4439"> The mind.</span><span id="en4440"> It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it.</span><span id="en4441"> It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself—as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner.</span><span id="en4442"> It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large.</span><span id="en4443"> But, unfortunately, there has been," he paused and took a deep breath—"a slight relapse."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4444"> The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, "Of how long duration?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4445"> "Nine days and nights."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4446"> "How did it show itself?</span><span id="en4447"> I infer," glancing at his hands again, "in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4448"> "That is the fact."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4449"> "Now, did you ever see him," asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, "engaged in that pursuit originally?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4450"> "Once."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4451"> "And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects—or in all respects—as he was then?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4452"> "I think in all respects."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4453"> "You spoke of his daughter.</span><span id="en4454"> Does his daughter know of the relapse?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4455"> "No.</span><span id="en4456"> It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.</span><span id="en4457"> It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4458"> The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, "That was very kind.</span><span id="en4459"> That was very thoughtful!"</span><span id="en4460"> Mr.</span><span id="en4461"> Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4462"> "Now, my dear Manette," said Mr.</span><span id="en4463"> Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, "I am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters.</span><span id="en4464"> I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding.</span><span id="en4465"> There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you.</span><span id="en4466"> Tell me, how does this relapse come about?</span><span id="en4467"> Is there danger of another?</span><span id="en4468"> Could a repetition of it be prevented?</span><span id="en4469"> How should a repetition of it be treated?</span><span id="en4470"> How does it come about at all?</span><span id="en4471"> What can I do for my friend?</span><span id="en4472"> No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4473"> "But I don't know how to originate, in such a case.</span><span id="en4474"> If your sagacity, knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.</span><span id="en4475"> Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly, and teach me how to be a little more useful."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4476"> Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr.</span><span id="en4477"> Lorry did not press him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4478"> "I think it probable," said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, "that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4479"> "Was it dreaded by him?"</span><span id="en4480"> Mr.</span><span id="en4481"> Lorry ventured to ask.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4482"> "Very much."</span><span id="en4483"> He said it with an involuntary shudder.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4484"> "You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's mind, and how difficult—how almost impossible—it is, for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4485"> "Would he," asked Mr.</span><span id="en4486"> Lorry, "be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on him?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4487"> "I think so.</span><span id="en4488"> But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible.</span><span id="en4489"> I even believe it—in some cases—to be quite impossible."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4490"> "Now," said Mr.</span><span id="en4491"> Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm again, after a short silence on both sides, "to what would you refer this attack?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4492"> "I believe," returned Doctor Manette, "that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady.</span><span id="en4493"> Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think.</span><span id="en4494"> It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would be recalled—say, under certain circumstances—say, on a particular occasion.</span><span id="en4495"> He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4496"> "Would he remember what took place in the relapse?"</span><span id="en4497"> asked Mr.</span><span id="en4498"> Lorry, with natural hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4499"> The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and answered, in a low voice, "Not at all."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4500"> "Now, as to the future," hinted Mr.</span><span id="en4501"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4502"> "As to the future," said the Doctor, recovering firmness, "I should have great hope.</span><span id="en4503"> As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I should have great hope.</span><span id="en4504"> He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that the worst was over."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4505"> "Well, well!</span><span id="en4506"> That's good comfort.</span><span id="en4507"> I am thankful!"</span><span id="en4508"> said Mr.</span><span id="en4509"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4510"> "I am thankful!"</span><span id="en4511"> repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4512"> "There are two other points," said Mr.</span><span id="en4513"> Lorry, "on which I am anxious to be instructed.</span><span id="en4514"> I may go on?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4515"> "You cannot do your friend a better service."</span><span id="en4516"> The Doctor gave him his hand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4517"> "To the first, then.</span><span id="en4518"> He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic; he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things.</span><span id="en4519"> Now, does he do too much?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4520"> "I think not.</span><span id="en4521"> It may be the character of his mind, to be always in singular need of occupation.</span><span id="en4522"> That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction.</span><span id="en4523"> The less it was occupied with healthy things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction.</span><span id="en4524"> He may have observed himself, and made the discovery."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4525"> "You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4526"> "I think I am quite sure of it."</span></p>

<p><span id="en4527"> "My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be.</span><span id="en4528"> There has been a violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4529"> "Excuse me, as a persistent man of business.</span><span id="en4530"> Assuming for a moment, that he was overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4531"> "I do not think so.</span><span id="en4532"> I do not think," said Doctor Manette with the firmness of self-conviction, "that anything but the one train of association would renew it.</span><span id="en4533"> I think that, henceforth, nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it.</span><span id="en4534"> After what has happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again.</span><span id="en4535"> I trust, and I almost believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4536"> He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress.</span><span id="en4537"> It was not for his friend to abate that confidence.</span><span id="en4538"> He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was, and approached his second and last point.</span><span id="en4539"> He felt it to be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days, he knew that he must face it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4540"> "The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from," said Mr.</span><span id="en4541"> Lorry, clearing his throat, "we will call—Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work.</span><span id="en4542"> We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge.</span><span id="en4543"> We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again.</span><span id="en4544"> Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4545"> The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot nervously on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4546"> "He has always kept it by him," said Mr.</span><span id="en4547"> Lorry, with an anxious look at his friend.</span><span id="en4548"> "Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4549"> Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4550"> "You do not find it easy to advise me?"</span><span id="en4551"> said Mr.</span><span id="en4552"> Lorry.</span><span id="en4553"> "I quite understand it to be a nice question.</span><span id="en4554"> And yet I think—" And there he shook his head, and stopped.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4555"> "You see," said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause, "it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings of this poor man's mind.</span><span id="en4556"> He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach.</span><span id="en4557"> Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4558"> He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr.</span><span id="en4559"> Lorry's face.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4560"> "But may not—mind!</span><span id="en4561"> I ask for information, as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and bank-notes—may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea?</span><span id="en4562"> If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go with it?</span><span id="en4563"> In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the forge?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4564"> There was another silence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4565"> "You see, too," said the Doctor, tremulously, "it is such an old companion."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4566"> "I would not keep it," said Mr.</span><span id="en4567"> Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted.</span><span id="en4568"> "I would recommend him to sacrifice it.</span><span id="en4569"> I only want your authority.</span><span id="en4570"> I am sure it does no good.</span><span id="en4571"> Come!</span><span id="en4572"> Give me your authority, like a dear good man.</span><span id="en4573"> For his daughter's sake, my dear Manette!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4574"> Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!</span></p>
<p><span id="en4575"> "In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it.</span><span id="en4576"> But, I would not take it away while he was present.</span><span id="en4577"> Let it be removed when he is not there; let him miss his old companion after an absence."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4578"> Mr.</span><span id="en4579"> Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended.</span><span id="en4580"> They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored.</span><span id="en4581"> On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband.</span><span id="en4582"> The precaution that had been taken to account for his silence, Mr.</span><span id="en4583"> Lorry had previously explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and she had no suspicions.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4584"> On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr.</span><span id="en4585"> Lorry went into his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross carrying a light.</span><span id="en4586"> There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr.</span><span id="en4587"> Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder—for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure.</span><span id="en4588"> The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden.</span><span id="en4589"> So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr.</span><span id="en4590"> Lorry and Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible crime.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-8_htm_html_pgepubid00029">XX. A Plea</h2>
<p><span id="en4591"> When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton.</span><span id="en4592"> They had not been at home many hours, when he presented himself.</span><span id="en4593"> He was not improved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4594"> He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of speaking to him when no one overheard.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4595"> "Mr.</span><span id="en4596"> Darnay," said Carton, "I wish we might be friends."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4597"> "We are already friends, I hope."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4598"> "You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't mean any fashion of speech.</span><span id="en4599"> Indeed, when I say I wish we might be friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4600"> Charles Darnay—as was natural—asked him, in all good-humour and good-fellowship, what he did mean?</span></p>
<p><span id="en4601"> "Upon my life," said Carton, smiling, "I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours.</span><span id="en4602"> However, let me try.</span><span id="en4603"> You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than—than usual?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4604"> "I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4605"> "I remember it too.</span><span id="en4606"> The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I always remember them.</span><span id="en4607"> I hope it may be taken into account one day, when all days are at an end for me!</span><span id="en4608"> Don't be alarmed; I am not going to preach."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4609"> "I am not at all alarmed.</span><span id="en4610"> Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming to me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4611"> "Ah!"</span><span id="en4612"> said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that away.</span><span id="en4613"> "On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you.</span><span id="en4614"> I wish you would forget it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4615"> "I forgot it long ago."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4616"> "Fashion of speech again!</span><span id="en4617"> But, Mr.</span><span id="en4618"> Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to me, as you represent it to be to you.</span><span id="en4619"> I have by no means forgotten it, and a light answer does not help me to forget it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4620"> "If it was a light answer," returned Darnay, "I beg your forgiveness for it.</span><span id="en4621"> I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside.</span><span id="en4622"> I declare to you, on the faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind.</span><span id="en4623"> Good Heaven, what was there to dismiss!</span><span id="en4624"> Have I had nothing more important to remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4625"> "As to the great service," said Carton, "I am bound to avow to you, when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.</span><span id="en4626"> —Mind!</span><span id="en4627"> I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4628"> "You make light of the obligation," returned Darnay, "but I will not quarrel with your light answer."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4629"> "Genuine truth, Mr.</span><span id="en4630"> Darnay, trust me!</span><span id="en4631"> I have gone aside from my purpose; I was speaking about our being friends.</span><span id="en4632"> Now, you know me; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men.</span><span id="en4633"> If you doubt it, ask Stryver, and he'll tell you so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4634"> "I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4635"> "Well!</span><span id="en4636"> At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done any good, and never will."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4637"> "I don't know that you 'never will.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4638"> "But I do, and you must take my word for it.</span><span id="en4639"> Well!</span><span id="en4640"> If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of.</span><span id="en4641"> I doubt if I should abuse the permission.</span><span id="en4642"> It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year.</span><span id="en4643"> It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know that I had it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4644"> "Will you try?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4645"> "That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated.</span><span id="en4646"> I thank you, Darnay.</span><span id="en4647"> I may use that freedom with your name?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4648"> "I think so, Carton, by this time."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4649"> They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away.</span><span id="en4650"> Within a minute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4651"> When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss Pross, the Doctor, and Mr.</span><span id="en4652"> Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness.</span><span id="en4653"> He spoke of him, in short, not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4654"> He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4655"> "We are thoughtful to-night!"</span><span id="en4656"> said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4657"> "Yes, dearest Charles," with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; "we are rather thoughtful to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4658"> "What is it, my Lucie?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4659"> "Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4660"> "Will I promise?</span><span id="en4661"> What will I not promise to my Love?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4662"> What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!</span></p>
<p><span id="en4663"> "I think, Charles, poor Mr.</span><span id="en4664"> Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4665"> "Indeed, my own?</span><span id="en4666"> Why so?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4667"> "That is what you are not to ask me.</span><span id="en4668"> But I think—I know—he does."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4669"> "If you know it, it is enough.</span><span id="en4670"> What would you have me do, my Life?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4671"> "I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by.</span><span id="en4672"> I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it.</span><span id="en4673"> My dear, I have seen it bleeding."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4674"> "It is a painful reflection to me," said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, "that I should have done him any wrong.</span><span id="en4675"> I never thought this of him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4676"> "My husband, it is so.</span><span id="en4677"> I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now.</span><span id="en4678"> But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4679"> She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4680"> "And, O my dearest Love!"</span><span id="en4681"> she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, "remember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4682"> The supplication touched him home.</span><span id="en4683"> "I will always remember it, dear Heart!</span><span id="en4684"> I will remember it as long as I live."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4685"> He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4686"> "God bless her for her sweet compassion!"</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-8_htm_html_pgepubid00030">XXI. Echoing Footsteps</h2>
<p><span id="en4687"> A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the Doctor lived.</span><span id="en4688"> Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4689"> At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be dimmed.</span><span id="en4690"> For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.</span><span id="en4691"> Fluttering hopes and doubts—hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight—divided her breast.</span><span id="en4692"> Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4693"> That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom.</span><span id="en4694"> Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words.</span><span id="en4695"> Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming.</span><span id="en4696"> They came, and the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred joy to her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4697"> Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds.</span><span id="en4698"> Her husband's step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and equal.</span><span id="en4699"> Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden!</span></p>
<p><span id="en4700"> Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel.</span><span id="en4701"> Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant smile, "Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!"</span><span id="en4702"> those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it.</span><span id="en4703"> Suffer them and forbid them not.</span><span id="en4704"> They see my Father's face.</span><span id="en4705"> O Father, blessed words!</span></p>
<p><span id="en4706"> Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven.</span><span id="en4707"> Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur—like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore—as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4708"> The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton.</span><span id="en4709"> Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often.</span><span id="en4710"> He never came there heated with wine.</span><span id="en4711"> And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4712"> No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him—an instinctive delicacy of pity for him.</span><span id="en4713"> What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here.</span><span id="en4714"> Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew.</span><span id="en4715"> The little boy had spoken of him, almost at the last.</span><span id="en4716"> "Poor Carton!</span><span id="en4717"> Kiss him for me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4718"> Mr.</span><span id="en4719"> Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in his wake, like a boat towed astern.</span><span id="en4720"> As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped life of it.</span><span id="en4721"> But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion.</span><span id="en4722"> Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4723"> These three young gentlemen, Mr.</span><span id="en4724"> Stryver, exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to Lucie's husband: delicately saying "Halloa!</span><span id="en4725"> here are three lumps of bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!"</span><span id="en4726"> The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.</span><span id="en4727"> Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow.</span><span id="en4728"> He was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs.</span><span id="en4729"> Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs.</span><span id="en4730"> Darnay had once put in practice to "catch" him, and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him "not to be caught."</span><span id="en4731"> Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himself—which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4732"> These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little daughter was six years old.</span><span id="en4733"> How near to her heart the echoes of her child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not be told.</span><span id="en4734"> Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her.</span><span id="en4735"> Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her "What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4736"> But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time.</span><span id="en4737"> And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4738"> On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.</span><span id="en4739"> Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window.</span><span id="en4740"> It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4741"> "I began to think," said Mr.</span><span id="en4742"> Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, "that I should have to pass the night at Tellson's.</span><span id="en4743"> We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn.</span><span id="en4744"> There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us!</span><span id="en4745"> Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough.</span><span id="en4746"> There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England."</span></p>

<p><span id="en4747"> "A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay?</span><span id="en4748"> Yes, but we don't know what reason there is in it.</span><span id="en4749"> People are so unreasonable!</span><span id="en4750"> Some of us at Tellson's are getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4751"> "Still," said Darnay, "you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4752"> "I know that, to be sure," assented Mr.</span><span id="en4753"> Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, "but I am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration.</span><span id="en4754"> Where is Manette?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4755"> "Here he is," said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4756"> "I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without reason.</span><span id="en4757"> You are not going out, I hope?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4758"> "No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like," said the Doctor.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4759"> "I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind.</span><span id="en4760"> I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night.</span><span id="en4761"> Is the teaboard still there, Lucie?</span><span id="en4762"> I can't see."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4763"> "Of course, it has been kept for you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4764"> "Thank ye, my dear.</span><span id="en4765"> The precious child is safe in bed?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4766"> "And sleeping soundly."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4767"> "That's right; all safe and well!</span><span id="en4768"> I don't know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out all day, and I am not as young as I was!</span><span id="en4769"> My tea, my dear!</span><span id="en4770"> Thank ye.</span><span id="en4771"> Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear the echoes about which you have your theory."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4772"> "Not a theory; it was a fancy."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4773"> "A fancy, then, my wise pet," said Mr.</span><span id="en4774"> Lorry, patting her hand.</span><span id="en4775"> "They are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not?</span><span id="en4776"> Only hear them!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4777"> Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in the dark London window.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4778"> Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun.</span><span id="en4779"> A tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4780"> Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed—so were cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise.</span><span id="en4781"> People who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls.</span><span id="en4782"> Every pulse and heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.</span><span id="en4783"> Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4784"> As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself, already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms, thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4785"> "Keep near to me, Jacques Three," cried Defarge; "and do you, Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can.</span><span id="en4786"> Where is my wife?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4787"> "Eh, well!</span><span id="en4788"> Here you see me!"</span><span id="en4789"> said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day.</span><span id="en4790"> Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4791"> "Where do you go, my wife?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4792"> "I go," said madame, "with you at present.</span><span id="en4793"> You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-bye."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4794"> "Come, then!"</span><span id="en4795"> cried Defarge, in a resounding voice.</span><span id="en4796"> "Patriots and friends, we are ready!</span><span id="en4797"> The Bastille!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4798"> With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point.</span><span id="en4799"> Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack began.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4800"> Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke.</span><span id="en4801"> Through the fire and through the smoke—in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier—Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4802"> Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke.</span><span id="en4803"> One drawbridge down!</span><span id="en4804"> "Work, comrades all, work!</span><span id="en4805"> Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all the Angels or the Devils—which you prefer—work!"</span><span id="en4806"> Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4807"> "To me, women!"</span><span id="en4808"> cried madame his wife.</span><span id="en4809"> "What!</span><span id="en4810"> We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!"</span><span id="en4811"> And to her, with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4812"> Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers.</span><span id="en4813"> Slight displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded.</span><span id="en4814"> Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of Four fierce hours.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4815"> A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley—this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it—suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!</span></p>
<p><span id="en4816"> So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the Bastille.</span><span id="en4817"> There, against an angle of a wall, he made a struggle to look about him.</span><span id="en4818"> Jacques Three was nearly at his side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the inner distance, and her knife was in her hand.</span><span id="en4819"> Everywhere was tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet furious dumb-show.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4820"> "The Prisoners!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4821"> "The Records!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4822"> "The secret cells!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4823"> "The instruments of torture!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4824"> "The Prisoners!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4825"> Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, "The Prisoners!"</span><span id="en4826"> was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an eternity of people, as well as of time and space.</span><span id="en4827"> When the foremost billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men—a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his hand—separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the wall.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4828"> "Show me the North Tower!"</span><span id="en4829"> said Defarge.</span><span id="en4830"> "Quick!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4831"> "I will faithfully," replied the man, "if you will come with me.</span><span id="en4832"> But there is no one there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4833"> "What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?"</span><span id="en4834"> asked Defarge.</span><span id="en4835"> "Quick!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4836"> "The meaning, monsieur?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4837"> "Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity?</span><span id="en4838"> Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4839"> "Kill him!"</span><span id="en4840"> croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4841"> "Monsieur, it is a cell."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4842"> "Show it me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4843"> "Pass this way, then."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4844"> Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed, held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's.</span><span id="en4845"> Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases.</span><span id="en4846"> All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4847"> Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps, and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make.</span><span id="en4848"> Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone.</span><span id="en4849"> Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.</span></p>

<p><span id="en4850"> "One hundred and five, North Tower!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4851"> There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall, with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up.</span><span id="en4852"> There was a small chimney, heavily barred across, a few feet within.</span><span id="en4853"> There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth.</span><span id="en4854"> There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed.</span><span id="en4855"> There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4856"> "Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them," said Defarge to the turnkey.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4857"> The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4858"> "Stop!</span><span id="en4859"> —Look here, Jacques!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4860"> "A.</span><span id="en4861"> !" croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4862"> "Alexandre Manette," said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder.</span><span id="en4863"> "And here he wrote 'a poor physician.</span><span id="en4864"> ' And it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone.</span><span id="en4865"> What is that in your hand?</span><span id="en4866"> A crowbar?</span><span id="en4867"> Give it me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4868"> He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand.</span><span id="en4869"> He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4870"> "Hold the light higher!"</span><span id="en4871"> he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey.</span><span id="en4872"> "Look among those fragments with care, Jacques.</span><span id="en4873"> And see!</span><span id="en4874"> Here is my knife," throwing it to him; "rip open that bed, and search the straw.</span><span id="en4875"> Hold the light higher, you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4876"> With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it.</span><span id="en4877"> In a few minutes, some mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a cautious touch.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4878"> "Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4879"> "Nothing."</span></p>
<p><span id="en4880"> "Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell.</span><span id="en4881"> So!</span><span id="en4882"> Light them, you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4883"> The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot.</span><span id="en4884"> Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4885"> They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself.</span><span id="en4886"> Saint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.</span><span id="en4887"> Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for judgment.</span><span id="en4888"> Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be unavenged.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4889"> In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman's.</span><span id="en4890"> "See, there is my husband!"</span><span id="en4891"> she cried, pointing him out.</span><span id="en4892"> "See Defarge!"</span><span id="en4893"> She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck, and with her cruel knife—long ready—hewed off his head.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4894"> The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do.</span><span id="en4895"> Saint Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down—down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the governor's body lay—down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation.</span><span id="en4896"> "Lower the lamp yonder!"</span><span id="en4897"> cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new means of death; "here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!"</span><span id="en4898"> The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4899"> The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown.</span><span id="en4900"> The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4901"> But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of faces—each seven in number—so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it.</span><span id="en4902"> Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.</span><span id="en4903"> Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day.</span><span id="en4904"> Impassive faces, yet with a suspended—not an abolished—expression on them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, "THOU DIDST IT!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4905"> Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,—such, and such—like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine.</span><span id="en4906"> Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life!</span><span id="en4907"> For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-9_htm_html_pgepubid00031">XXII. The Sea Still Rises</h2>
<p><span id="en4908"> Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.</span><span id="en4909"> Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies.</span><span id="en4910"> The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4911"> Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street.</span><span id="en4912"> In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress.</span><span id="en4913"> The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: "I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?"</span><span id="en4914"> Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.</span><span id="en4915"> The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that they could tear.</span><span id="en4916"> There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4917"> Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women.</span><span id="en4918"> One of her sisterhood knitted beside her.</span><span id="en4919"> The short, rather plump wife of a starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4920"> "Hark!"</span><span id="en4921"> said The Vengeance.</span><span id="en4922"> "Listen, then!</span><span id="en4923"> Who comes?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4924"> As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4925"> "It is Defarge," said madame.</span><span id="en4926"> "Silence, patriots!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4927"> Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked around him!</span><span id="en4928"> "Listen, everywhere!"</span><span id="en4929"> said madame again.</span><span id="en4930"> "Listen to him!"</span><span id="en4931"> Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4932"> "Say then, my husband.</span><span id="en4933"> What is it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4934"> "News from the other world!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4935"> "How, then?"</span><span id="en4936"> cried madame, contemptuously.</span><span id="en4937"> "The other world?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4938"> "Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4939"> "Everybody!"</span><span id="en4940"> from all throats.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4941"> "The news is of him.</span><span id="en4942"> He is among us!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4943"> "Among us!"</span><span id="en4944"> from the universal throat again.</span><span id="en4945"> "And dead?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4946"> "Not dead!</span><span id="en4947"> He feared us so much—and with reason—that he caused himself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral.</span><span id="en4948"> But they have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in.</span><span id="en4949"> I have seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner.</span><span id="en4950"> I have said that he had reason to fear us.</span><span id="en4951"> Say all!</span><span id="en4952"> Had he reason?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4953"> Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4954"> A moment of profound silence followed.</span><span id="en4955"> Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another.</span><span id="en4956"> The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4957"> "Patriots!"</span><span id="en4958"> said Defarge, in a determined voice, "are we ready?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4959"> Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to house, rousing the women.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4960"> The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest.</span><span id="en4961"> From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.</span><span id="en4962"> Villain Foulon taken, my sister!</span><span id="en4963"> Old Foulon taken, my mother!</span><span id="en4964"> Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter!</span><span id="en4965"> Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive!</span><span id="en4966"> Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass!</span><span id="en4967"> Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him!</span><span id="en4968"> Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want!</span><span id="en4969"> O mother of God, this Foulon!</span><span id="en4970"> O Heaven our suffering!</span><span id="en4971"> Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon!</span><span id="en4972"> Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him!</span><span id="en4973"> With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4974"> Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment!</span><span id="en4975"> This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed.</span><span id="en4976"> Never, if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs!</span><span id="en4977"> Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4978"> No.</span><span id="en4979"> They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets.</span><span id="en4980"> The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance from him in the Hall.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4981"> "See!"</span><span id="en4982"> cried madame, pointing with her knife.</span><span id="en4983"> "See the old villain bound with ropes.</span><span id="en4984"> That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.</span><span id="en4985"> Ha, ha!</span><span id="en4986"> That was well done.</span><span id="en4987"> Let him eat it now!"</span><span id="en4988"> Madame put her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4989"> The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands.</span><span id="en4990"> Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4991"> At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head.</span><span id="en4992"> The favour was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got him!</span></p>
<p><span id="en4993"> It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd.</span><span id="en4994"> Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace—Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied—The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches—when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, "Bring him out!</span><span id="en4995"> Bring him to the lamp!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en4996"> Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go—as a cat might have done to a mouse—and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth.</span><span id="en4997"> Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.</span></p>
<p><span id="en4998"> Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone.</span><span id="en4999"> Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him—would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company—set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through the streets.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5000"> Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless.</span><span id="en5001"> Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip.</span><span id="en5002"> Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5003"> Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sauce to wretched bread.</span><span id="en5004"> Yet, human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them.</span><span id="en5005"> Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped.</span></p>

<p><span id="en5006"> "At last it is come, my dear!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5007"> "Eh well!"</span><span id="en5008"> returned madame.</span><span id="en5009"> "Almost."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5010"> Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest.</span><span id="en5011"> The drum's was the only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed.</span><span id="en5012"> The Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint Antoine's bosom.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-9_htm_html_pgepubid00032">XXIII. Fire Rises</h2>
<p><span id="en5013"> There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together.</span><span id="en5014"> The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would do—beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5015"> Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.</span><span id="en5016"> Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people.</span><span id="en5017"> Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken.</span><span id="en5018"> Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them—all worn out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5019"> Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this.</span><span id="en5020"> Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out!</span><span id="en5021"> There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely!</span><span id="en5022"> Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5023"> But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it.</span><span id="en5024"> For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase—now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness.</span><span id="en5025"> No.</span><span id="en5026"> The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5027"> For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it—in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence.</span><span id="en5028"> As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5029"> Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather, as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5030"> The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill, and at the prison on the crag.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5031"> "How goes it, Jacques?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5032"> "All well, Jacques."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5033"> "Touch then!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5034"> They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5035"> "No dinner?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5036"> "Nothing but supper now," said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5037"> "It is the fashion," growled the man.</span><span id="en5038"> "I meet no dinner anywhere."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5039"> He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5040"> "Touch then."</span><span id="en5041"> It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations.</span><span id="en5042"> They again joined hands.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5043"> "To-night?"</span><span id="en5044"> said the mender of roads.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5045"> "To-night," said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5046"> "Where?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5047"> "Here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5048"> He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5049"> "Show me!"</span><span id="en5050"> said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5051"> "See!"</span><span id="en5052"> returned the mender of roads, with extended finger.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5053"> "To the Devil with all that!"</span><span id="en5054"> interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape.</span><span id="en5055"> "I go through no streets and past no fountains.</span><span id="en5056"> Well?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5057"> "Well!</span><span id="en5058"> About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5059"> "Good.</span><span id="en5060"> When do you cease to work?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5061"> "At sunset."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5062"> "Will you wake me, before departing?</span><span id="en5063"> I have walked two nights without resting.</span><span id="en5064"> Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child.</span><span id="en5065"> Will you wake me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5066"> "Surely."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5067"> The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones.</span><span id="en5068"> He was fast asleep directly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5069"> As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones.</span><span id="en5070"> His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.</span><span id="en5071"> The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe.</span><span id="en5072"> The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores.</span><span id="en5073"> Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.</span><span id="en5074"> Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure.</span><span id="en5075"> And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5076"> The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing.</span><span id="en5077"> Then, the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village, roused him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5078"> "Good!"</span><span id="en5079"> said the sleeper, rising on his elbow.</span><span id="en5080"> "Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5081"> "About."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5082"> "About.</span><span id="en5083"> Good!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5084"> The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.</span><span id="en5085"> When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there.</span><span id="en5086"> A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only.</span><span id="en5087"> Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5088"> The night deepened.</span><span id="en5089"> The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom.</span><span id="en5090"> Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept.</span><span id="en5091"> East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard.</span><span id="en5092"> Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5093"> But, not for long.</span><span id="en5094"> Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.</span><span id="en5095"> Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were.</span><span id="en5096"> Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.</span><span id="en5097"> Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5098"> A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away.</span><span id="en5099"> There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door.</span><span id="en5100"> "Help, Gabelle!</span><span id="en5101"> Help, every one!"</span><span id="en5102"> The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none.</span><span id="en5103"> The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky.</span><span id="en5104"> "It must be forty feet high," said they, grimly; and never moved.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5105"> The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag.</span><span id="en5106"> At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers.</span><span id="en5107"> "Help, gentlemen—officers!</span><span id="en5108"> The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid!</span><span id="en5109"> Help, help!"</span><span id="en5110"> The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, "It must burn."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5111"> As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating.</span><span id="en5112"> The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass.</span><span id="en5113"> The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5114"> The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn.</span><span id="en5115"> In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away.</span><span id="en5116"> With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment.</span><span id="en5117"> When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5118"> The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke.</span><span id="en5119"> Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame.</span><span id="en5120"> Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination.</span><span id="en5121"> The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5122"> Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes—though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days—became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference.</span><span id="en5123"> Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself.</span><span id="en5124"> The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5125"> Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.</span><span id="en5126"> A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved!</span><span id="en5127"> But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5128"> Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn.</span><span id="en5129"> But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.</span><span id="en5130"> The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-9_htm_html_pgepubid00033">XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock</h2>
<p><span id="en5131"> In such risings of fire and risings of sea—the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore—three years of tempest were consumed.</span><span id="en5132"> Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5133"> Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet.</span><span id="en5134"> For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5135"> Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and this life together.</span><span id="en5136"> Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years, and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5137"> The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets.</span><span id="en5138"> It had never been a good eye to see with—had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride, Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness—but it had dropped out and was gone.</span><span id="en5139"> The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together.</span><span id="en5140"> Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and "suspended," when the last tidings came over.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5141"> The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5142"> As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank.</span><span id="en5143"> Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.</span><span id="en5144"> Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest.</span><span id="en5145"> Again: Tellson's was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate.</span><span id="en5146"> Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren.</span><span id="en5147"> To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as a matter of course.</span><span id="en5148"> For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5149"> On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr.</span><span id="en5150"> Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice.</span><span id="en5151"> The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing.</span><span id="en5152"> It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing.</span></p>

<p><span id="en5153"> "I understand.</span><span id="en5154"> That I am too old?"</span><span id="en5155"> said Mr.</span><span id="en5156"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5157"> "Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5158"> "My dear Charles," said Mr.</span><span id="en5159"> Lorry, with cheerful confidence, "you touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away.</span><span id="en5160"> It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with.</span><span id="en5161"> As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellson's confidence.</span><span id="en5162"> As to the uncertain travelling, the long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all these years, who ought to be?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5163"> "I wish I were going myself," said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5164"> "Indeed!</span><span id="en5165"> You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!"</span><span id="en5166"> exclaimed Mr.</span><span id="en5167"> Lorry.</span><span id="en5168"> "You wish you were going yourself?</span><span id="en5169"> And you a Frenchman born?</span><span id="en5170"> You are a wise counsellor."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5171"> "My dear Mr.</span><span id="en5172"> Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through my mind often.</span><span id="en5173"> One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them," he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, "that one might be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some restraint.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5174"> "When you were talking to Lucie," Mr.</span><span id="en5175"> Lorry repeated.</span><span id="en5176"> "Yes.</span><span id="en5177"> I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie!</span><span id="en5178"> Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5179"> "However, I am not going," said Charles Darnay, with a smile.</span><span id="en5180"> "It is more to the purpose that you say you are."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5181"> "And I am, in plain reality.</span><span id="en5182"> The truth is, my dear Charles," Mr.</span><span id="en5183"> Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, "you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved.</span><span id="en5184"> The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow!</span><span id="en5185"> Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one.</span><span id="en5186"> And shall I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this—Tellson's, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years—because I am a little stiff about the joints?</span><span id="en5187"> Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5188"> "How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr.</span><span id="en5189"> Lorry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5190"> "Tut!</span><span id="en5191"> Nonsense, sir!</span><span id="en5192"> —And, my dear Charles," said Mr.</span><span id="en5193"> Lorry, glancing at the House again, "you are to remember, that getting things out of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility.</span><span id="en5194"> Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers.</span><span id="en5195"> At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5196"> "And do you really go to-night?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5197"> "I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5198"> "And do you take no one with you?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5199"> "All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them.</span><span id="en5200"> I intend to take Jerry.</span><span id="en5201"> Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.</span><span id="en5202"> Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5203"> "I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5204"> "I must say again, nonsense, nonsense!</span><span id="en5205"> When I have executed this little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease.</span><span id="en5206"> Time enough, then, to think about growing old."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5207"> This dialogue had taken place at Mr.</span><span id="en5208"> Lorry's usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long.</span><span id="en5209"> It was too much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown—as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it—as if observers of the wretched millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw.</span><span id="en5210"> Such vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth.</span><span id="en5211"> And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5212"> Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race.</span><span id="en5213"> Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5214"> The House approached Mr.</span><span id="en5215"> Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed?</span><span id="en5216"> The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction—the more quickly because it was his own right name.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5217"> "Very pressing.</span><span id="en5218"> To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St.</span><span id="en5219"> Evremonde, of France.</span><span id="en5220"> Confided to the cares of Messrs.</span><span id="en5221"> Tellson and Co.</span><span id="en5222"> , Bankers, London, England."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5223"> On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be—unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation—kept inviolate between them.</span><span id="en5224"> Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact; Mr.</span><span id="en5225"> Lorry could have none.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5226"> "No," said Mr.</span><span id="en5227"> Lorry, in reply to the House; "I have referred it, I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5228"> The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr.</span><span id="en5229"> Lorry's desk.</span><span id="en5230"> He held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5231"> "Nephew, I believe—but in any case degenerate successor—of the polished Marquis who was murdered," said one.</span><span id="en5232"> "Happy to say, I never knew him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5233"> "A craven who abandoned his post," said another—this Monseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of hay—"some years ago."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5234"> "Infected with the new doctrines," said a third, eyeing the direction through his glass in passing; "set himself in opposition to the last Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the ruffian herd.</span><span id="en5235"> They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5236"> "Hey?"</span><span id="en5237"> cried the blatant Stryver.</span><span id="en5238"> "Did he though?</span><span id="en5239"> Is that the sort of fellow?</span><span id="en5240"> Let us look at his infamous name.</span><span id="en5241"> D—n the fellow!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5242"> Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5243"> "I know the fellow."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5244"> "Do you, by Jupiter?"</span><span id="en5245"> said Stryver.</span><span id="en5246"> "I am sorry for it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5247"> "Why?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5248"> "Why, Mr.</span><span id="en5249"> Darnay?</span><span id="en5250"> D'ye hear what he did?</span><span id="en5251"> Don't ask, why, in these times."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5252"> "But I do ask why?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5253"> "Then I tell you again, Mr.</span><span id="en5254"> Darnay, I am sorry for it.</span><span id="en5255"> I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions.</span><span id="en5256"> Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him?</span><span id="en5257"> Well, but I'll answer you.</span><span id="en5258"> I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel.</span><span id="en5259"> That's why."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5260"> Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and said: "You may not understand the gentleman."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5261"> "I understand how to put you in a corner, Mr.</span><span id="en5262"> Darnay," said Bully Stryver, "and I'll do it.</span><span id="en5263"> If this fellow is a gentleman, I don't understand him.</span><span id="en5264"> You may tell him so, with my compliments.</span><span id="en5265"> You may also tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them.</span><span id="en5266"> But, no, gentlemen," said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers, "I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious protégés.</span><span id="en5267"> No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5268"> With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr.</span><span id="en5269"> Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his hearers.</span><span id="en5270"> Mr.</span><span id="en5271"> Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in the general departure from the Bank.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5272"> "Will you take charge of the letter?"</span><span id="en5273"> said Mr.</span><span id="en5274"> Lorry.</span><span id="en5275"> "You know where to deliver it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5276"> "I do."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5277"> "Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5278"> "I will do so.</span><span id="en5279"> Do you start for Paris from here?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5280"> "From here, at eight."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5281"> "I will come back, to see you off."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5282"> Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5283"> "Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5284"> "June 21, 1792.</span><span id="en5285"> "MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5286"> "After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris.</span><span id="en5287"> On the road I have suffered a great deal.</span><span id="en5288"> Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed—razed to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5289"> "The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant.</span><span id="en5290"> It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not against, according to your commands.</span><span id="en5291"> It is in vain I represent that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process.</span><span id="en5292"> The only response is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?</span></p>
<p><span id="en5293"> "Ah!</span><span id="en5294"> most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that emigrant?</span><span id="en5295"> I cry in my sleep where is he?</span><span id="en5296"> I demand of Heaven, will he not come to deliver me?</span><span id="en5297"> No answer.</span><span id="en5298"> Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!</span></p>
<p><span id="en5299"> "For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to succour and release me.</span><span id="en5300"> My fault is, that I have been true to you.</span><span id="en5301"> Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!</span></p>
<p><span id="en5302"> "From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.</span></p>

<p><span id="en5303"> "Gabelle."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5304"> The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter.</span><span id="en5305"> The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5306"> He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold, he had acted imperfectly.</span><span id="en5307"> He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie, his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and incomplete.</span><span id="en5308"> He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to do it, and that it had never been done.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5309"> The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded:—not without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance.</span><span id="en5310"> That he had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5311"> But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread.</span><span id="en5312"> Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give—such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer—and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5313"> This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make, that he would go to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5314"> Yes.</span><span id="en5315"> Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go.</span><span id="en5316"> Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction.</span><span id="en5317"> His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity.</span><span id="en5318"> With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were coarse and galling, for old reasons.</span><span id="en5319"> Upon those, had followed Gabelle's letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and good name.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5320"> His resolution was made.</span><span id="en5321"> He must go to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5322"> Yes.</span><span id="en5323"> The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck.</span><span id="en5324"> He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger.</span><span id="en5325"> The intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it.</span><span id="en5326"> Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5327"> As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.</span><span id="en5328"> Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt.</span><span id="en5329"> How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself.</span><span id="en5330"> But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5331"> He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr.</span><span id="en5332"> Lorry.</span><span id="en5333"> As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5334"> A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5335"> "I have delivered that letter," said Charles Darnay to Mr.</span><span id="en5336"> Lorry.</span><span id="en5337"> "I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5338"> "That I will, and readily," said Mr.</span><span id="en5339"> Lorry, "if it is not dangerous."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5340"> "Not at all.</span><span id="en5341"> Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5342"> "What is his name?"</span><span id="en5343"> said Mr.</span><span id="en5344"> Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5345"> "Gabelle."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5346"> "Gabelle.</span><span id="en5347"> And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5348"> "Simply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5349"> "Any time mentioned?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5350"> "He will start upon his journey to-morrow night."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5351"> "Any person mentioned?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5352"> "No."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5353"> He helped Mr.</span><span id="en5354"> Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street.</span><span id="en5355"> "My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie," said Mr.</span><span id="en5356"> Lorry at parting, "and take precious care of them till I come back."</span><span id="en5357"> Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5358"> That night—it was the fourteenth of August—he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.</span><span id="en5359"> To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5360"> It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind.</span><span id="en5361"> It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.</span><span id="en5362"> But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and the day passed quickly.</span><span id="en5363"> Early in the evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5364"> The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it.</span><span id="en5365"> He left his two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.</span><span id="en5366"> "For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name!"</span><span id="en5367"> was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and floated away for the Loadstone Rock.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-10_htm_html_pgepubid00035">I. In Secret</h2>
<p><span id="en5369"> The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two.</span><span id="en5370"> More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these.</span><span id="en5371"> Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5372"> A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris.</span><span id="en5373"> Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end.</span><span id="en5374"> Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England.</span><span id="en5375"> The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5376"> This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge.</span><span id="en5377"> He had been days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5378"> Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far.</span><span id="en5379"> His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis.</span><span id="en5380"> And he was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5381"> Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5382"> "Emigrant," said the functionary, "I am going to send you on to Paris, under an escort."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5383"> "Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could dispense with the escort."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5384"> "Silence!"</span><span id="en5385"> growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket.</span><span id="en5386"> "Peace, aristocrat!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5387"> "It is as the good patriot says," observed the timid functionary.</span><span id="en5388"> "You are an aristocrat, and must have an escort—and must pay for it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5389"> "I have no choice," said Charles Darnay.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5390"> "Choice!</span><span id="en5391"> Listen to him!"</span><span id="en5392"> cried the same scowling red-cap.</span><span id="en5393"> "As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5394"> "It is always as the good patriot says," observed the functionary.</span><span id="en5395"> "Rise and dress yourself, emigrant."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5396"> Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire.</span><span id="en5397"> Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5398"> The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5399"> The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist.</span><span id="en5400"> In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the mire-deep roads.</span><span id="en5401"> In this state they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5402"> They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell.</span><span id="en5403"> The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off.</span><span id="en5404"> Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5405"> But when they came to the town of Beauvais—which they did at eventide, when the streets were filled with people—he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming.</span><span id="en5406"> An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called out loudly, "Down with the emigrant!"</span></p>

<p><span id="en5407"> "Emigrant, my friends!</span><span id="en5408"> Do you not see me here, in France, of my own will?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5409"> "You are a cursed emigrant," cried a farrier, making at him in a furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; "and you are a cursed aristocrat!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5410"> The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, "Let him be; let him be!</span><span id="en5411"> He will be judged at Paris."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5412"> "Judged!"</span><span id="en5413"> repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer.</span><span id="en5414"> "Ay!</span><span id="en5415"> and condemned as a traitor."</span><span id="en5416"> At this the crowd roared approval.</span></p>

<p><span id="en5417"> "Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived.</span><span id="en5418"> I am not a traitor."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5419"> "He lies!"</span><span id="en5420"> cried the smith.</span><span id="en5421"> "He is a traitor since the decree.</span><span id="en5422"> His life is forfeit to the people.</span><span id="en5423"> His cursed life is not his own!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5424"> At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates.</span><span id="en5425"> The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no more was done.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5426"> "What is this decree that the smith spoke of?"</span><span id="en5427"> Darnay asked the postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5428"> "Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5429"> "When passed?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5430"> "On the fourteenth."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5431"> "The day I left England!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5432"> "Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be others—if there are not already—banishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who return.</span><span id="en5433"> That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5434"> "But there are no such decrees yet?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5435"> "What do I know!"</span><span id="en5436"> said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; "there may be, or there will be.</span><span id="en5437"> It is all the same.</span><span id="en5438"> What would you have?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5439"> They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep.</span><span id="en5440"> Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep.</span><span id="en5441"> After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song.</span><span id="en5442"> Happily, however, there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5443"> Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris.</span><span id="en5444"> The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5445"> "Where are the papers of this prisoner?"</span><span id="en5446"> demanded a resolute-looking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5447"> Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5448"> "Where," repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him whatever, "are the papers of this prisoner?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5449"> The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them.</span><span id="en5450"> Casting his eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5451"> He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate.</span><span id="en5452"> Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult.</span><span id="en5453"> A numerous medley of men and women, not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they filtered through the barrier very slowly.</span><span id="en5454"> Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about.</span><span id="en5455"> The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5456"> When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority, who directed the guard to open the barrier.</span><span id="en5457"> Then he delivered to the escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him to dismount.</span><span id="en5458"> He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse, turned and rode away without entering the city.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5459"> He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.</span><span id="en5460"> The light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly uncertain condition.</span><span id="en5461"> Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5462"> "Citizen Defarge," said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of paper to write on.</span><span id="en5463"> "Is this the emigrant Evremonde?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5464"> "This is the man."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5465"> "Your age, Evremonde?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5466"> "Thirty-seven."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5467"> "Married, Evremonde?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5468"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5469"> "Where married?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5470"> "In England."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5471"> "Without doubt.</span><span id="en5472"> Where is your wife, Evremonde?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5473"> "In England."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5474"> "Without doubt.</span><span id="en5475"> You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La Force."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5476"> "Just Heaven!"</span><span id="en5477"> exclaimed Darnay.</span><span id="en5478"> "Under what law, and for what offence?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5479"> The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5480"> "We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here."</span><span id="en5481"> He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5482"> "I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you.</span><span id="en5483"> I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay.</span><span id="en5484"> Is not that my right?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5485"> "Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde," was the stolid reply.</span><span id="en5486"> The officer wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words "In secret."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5487"> Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him.</span><span id="en5488"> The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5489"> "Is it you," said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, "who married the daughter of Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5490"> "Yes," replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5491"> "My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint Antoine.</span><span id="en5492"> Possibly you have heard of me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5493"> "My wife came to your house to reclaim her father?</span><span id="en5494"> Yes!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5495"> The word "wife" seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say with sudden impatience, "In the name of that sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5496"> "You heard me say why, a minute ago.</span><span id="en5497"> Do you not believe it is the truth?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5498"> "A bad truth for you," said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and looking straight before him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5499"> "Indeed I am lost here.</span><span id="en5500"> All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost.</span><span id="en5501"> Will you render me a little help?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5502"> "None."</span><span id="en5503"> Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5504"> "Will you answer me a single question?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5505"> "Perhaps.</span><span id="en5506"> According to its nature.</span><span id="en5507"> You can say what it is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5508"> "In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5509"> "You will see."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5510"> "I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of presenting my case?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5511"> "You will see.</span><span id="en5512"> But, what then?</span><span id="en5513"> Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons, before now."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5514"> "But never by me, Citizen Defarge."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5515"> Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady and set silence.</span><span id="en5516"> The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope there was—or so Darnay thought—of his softening in any slight degree.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5517"> "It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to Mr.</span><span id="en5518"> Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force.</span><span id="en5519"> Will you cause that to be done for me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5520"> "I will do," Defarge doggedly rejoined, "nothing for you.</span><span id="en5521"> My duty is to my country and the People.</span><span id="en5522"> I am the sworn servant of both, against you.</span><span id="en5523"> I will do nothing for you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5524"> Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride was touched besides.</span><span id="en5525"> As they walked on in silence, he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets.</span><span id="en5526"> The very children scarcely noticed him.</span><span id="en5527"> A few passers turned their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work.</span><span id="en5528"> In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family.</span><span id="en5529"> The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris.</span><span id="en5530"> On the road (except at Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing.</span><span id="en5531"> The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5532"> That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now.</span><span id="en5533"> That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course knew now.</span><span id="en5534"> He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events of a few days.</span><span id="en5535"> And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by the light of this later time, they would appear.</span><span id="en5536"> Troubled as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope.</span><span id="en5537"> The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away.</span><span id="en5538"> The "sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine," was hardly known to him, or to the generality of people, by name.</span><span id="en5539"> The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers.</span><span id="en5540"> How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?</span></p>
<p><span id="en5541"> Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly.</span><span id="en5542"> With this on his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he arrived at the prison of La Force.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5543"> A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented "The Emigrant Evremonde."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5544"> "What the Devil!</span><span id="en5545"> How many more of them!"</span><span id="en5546"> exclaimed the man with the bloated face.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5547"> Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his two fellow-patriots.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5548"> "What the Devil, I say again!"</span><span id="en5549"> exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.</span><span id="en5550"> "How many more!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5551"> The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, "One must have patience, my dear!"</span><span id="en5552"> Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, "For the love of Liberty;" which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5553"> The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it.</span><span id="en5554"> Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for!</span></p>
<p><span id="en5555"> "In secret, too," grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper.</span><span id="en5556"> "As if I was not already full to bursting!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5557"> He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5558"> "Come!"</span><span id="en5559"> said the chief, at length taking up his keys, "come with me, emigrant."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5560"> Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.</span><span id="en5561"> The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the room.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5562"> In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company.</span><span id="en5563"> But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5564"> So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead.</span><span id="en5565"> Ghosts all!</span><span id="en5566"> The ghost of beauty, the ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5567"> It struck him motionless.</span><span id="en5568"> The gaoler standing at his side, and the other gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there—with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred—that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its utmost.</span><span id="en5569"> Surely, ghosts all.</span><span id="en5570"> Surely, the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!</span></p>
<p><span id="en5571"> "In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune," said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, "I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us.</span><span id="en5572"> May it soon terminate happily!</span><span id="en5573"> It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5574"> Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in words as suitable as he could find.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5575"> "But I hope," said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his eyes, who moved across the room, "that you are not in secret?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5576"> "I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5577"> "Ah, what a pity!</span><span id="en5578"> We so much regret it!</span><span id="en5579"> But take courage; several members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but a short time."</span><span id="en5580"> Then he added, raising his voice, "I grieve to inform the society—in secret."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5581"> There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices—among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous—gave him good wishes and encouragement.</span><span id="en5582"> He turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5583"> The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward.</span><span id="en5584"> When they had ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell.</span><span id="en5585"> It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5586"> "Yours," said the gaoler.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5587"> "Why am I confined alone?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5588"> "How do I know!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5589"> "I can buy pen, ink, and paper?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5590"> "Such are not my orders.</span><span id="en5591"> You will be visited, and can ask then.</span><span id="en5592"> At present, you may buy your food, and nothing more."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5593"> There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress.</span><span id="en5594"> As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water.</span><span id="en5595"> When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, "Now am I left, as if I were dead."</span><span id="en5596"> Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, "And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5597"> "Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half."</span><span id="en5598"> The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them.</span><span id="en5599"> "He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes."</span><span id="en5600"> The prisoner counted the measurement again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.</span><span id="en5601"> "The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed.</span><span id="en5602"> There was one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake!</span><span id="en5603"> * * * * He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes.</span><span id="en5604"> * * * * Five paces by four and a half."</span><span id="en5605"> With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent—that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-10_htm_html_pgepubid00036">II. The Grindstone</h2>
<p><span id="en5606"> Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate.</span><span id="en5607"> The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders.</span><span id="en5608"> A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5609"> Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated.</span><span id="en5610"> For, all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5611"> A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris, would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.</span><span id="en5612"> For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over the counter?</span><span id="en5613"> Yet such things were.</span><span id="en5614"> Tellson's had whitewashed the Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to night.</span><span id="en5615"> Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest provocation.</span><span id="en5616"> Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5617"> What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr.</span><span id="en5618"> Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions.</span><span id="en5619"> He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflect—a shade of horror.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5620"> He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy.</span><span id="en5621"> It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that.</span><span id="en5622"> All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty.</span><span id="en5623"> On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing—for carriages—where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood.</span><span id="en5624"> Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other workshop.</span><span id="en5625"> Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, Mr.</span><span id="en5626"> Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire.</span><span id="en5627"> He had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5628"> From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5629"> "Thank God," said Mr.</span><span id="en5630"> Lorry, clasping his hands, "that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night.</span><span id="en5631"> May He have mercy on all who are in danger!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5632"> Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought, "They have come back!"</span><span id="en5633"> and sat listening.</span><span id="en5634"> But, there was no loud irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate clash again, and all was quiet.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5635"> The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally awaken, with such feelings roused.</span><span id="en5636"> It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5637"> Lucie and her father!</span><span id="en5638"> Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5639"> "What is this?"</span><span id="en5640"> cried Mr.</span><span id="en5641"> Lorry, breathless and confused.</span><span id="en5642"> "What is the matter?</span><span id="en5643"> Lucie!</span><span id="en5644"> Manette!</span><span id="en5645"> What has happened?</span><span id="en5646"> What has brought you here?</span><span id="en5647"> What is it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5648"> With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, "O my dear friend!</span><span id="en5649"> My husband!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5650"> "Your husband, Lucie?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5651"> "Charles."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5652"> "What of Charles?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5653"> "Here.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5654"> "Here, in Paris?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5655"> "Has been here some days—three or four—I don't know how many—I can't collect my thoughts.</span><span id="en5656"> An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5657"> The old man uttered an irrepressible cry.</span><span id="en5658"> Almost at the same moment, the beg of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5659"> "What is that noise?"</span><span id="en5660"> said the Doctor, turning towards the window.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5661"> "Don't look!"</span><span id="en5662"> cried Mr.</span><span id="en5663"> Lorry.</span><span id="en5664"> "Don't look out!</span><span id="en5665"> Manette, for your life, don't touch the blind!"</span></p>

<p><span id="en5666"> "My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city.</span><span id="en5667"> I have been a Bastille prisoner.</span><span id="en5668"> There is no patriot in Paris—in Paris?</span><span id="en5669"> In France—who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.</span><span id="en5670"> My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here.</span><span id="en5671"> I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.</span><span id="en5672"> —What is that noise?"</span><span id="en5673"> His hand was again upon the window.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5674"> "Don't look!"</span><span id="en5675"> cried Mr.</span><span id="en5676"> Lorry, absolutely desperate.</span><span id="en5677"> "No, Lucie, my dear, nor you!"</span><span id="en5678"> He got his arm round her, and held her.</span><span id="en5679"> "Don't be so terrified, my love.</span><span id="en5680"> I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place.</span><span id="en5681"> What prison is he in?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5682"> "La Force!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5683"> "La Force!</span><span id="en5684"> Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life—and you were always both—you will compose yourself now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or I can say.</span><span id="en5685"> There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out.</span><span id="en5686"> I say this, because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all.</span><span id="en5687"> You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet.</span><span id="en5688"> You must let me put you in a room at the back here.</span><span id="en5689"> You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5690"> "I will be submissive to you.</span><span id="en5691"> I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this.</span><span id="en5692"> I know you are true."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5693"> The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm, and looked out with him into the courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5694"> Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all.</span><span id="en5695"> The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5696"> But, such awful workers, and such awful work!</span></p>
<p><span id="en5697"> The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.</span><span id="en5698"> False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep.</span><span id="en5699"> As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire.</span><span id="en5700"> The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood.</span><span id="en5701"> Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through.</span><span id="en5702"> Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it.</span><span id="en5703"> Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour.</span><span id="en5704"> And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;—eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5705"> All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it were there.</span><span id="en5706"> They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend's ashy face.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5707"> "They are," Mr.</span><span id="en5708"> Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at the locked room, "murdering the prisoners.</span><span id="en5709"> If you are sure of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have—as I believe you have—make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force.</span><span id="en5710"> It may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5711"> Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the courtyard when Mr.</span><span id="en5712"> Lorry regained the blind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5713"> His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.</span><span id="en5714"> For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr.</span><span id="en5715"> Lorry saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of—"Live the Bastille prisoner!</span><span id="en5716"> Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in La Force!</span><span id="en5717"> Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there!</span><span id="en5718"> Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!"</span><span id="en5719"> and a thousand answering shouts.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5720"> He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband.</span><span id="en5721"> He found her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5722"> Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand.</span><span id="en5723"> Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge.</span><span id="en5724"> O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife!</span><span id="en5725"> And O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!</span></p>
<p><span id="en5726"> Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.</span><span id="en5727"> "What is it?"</span><span id="en5728"> cried Lucie, affrighted.</span><span id="en5729"> "Hush!</span><span id="en5730"> The soldiers' swords are sharpened there," said Mr.</span><span id="en5731"> Lorry.</span><span id="en5732"> "The place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5733"> Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.</span><span id="en5734"> Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again.</span><span id="en5735"> A man, so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.</span><span id="en5736"> Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5737"> The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr.</span><span id="en5738"> Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard.</span><span id="en5739"> But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-10_htm_html_pgepubid00037">III. The Shadow</h2>
<p><span id="en5740"> One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.</span><span id="en5741"> Lorry when business hours came round, was this:—that he had no right to imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof.</span><span id="en5742"> His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5743"> At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city.</span><span id="en5744"> But, the same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5745"> Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr.</span><span id="en5746"> Lorry advised with Lucie.</span><span id="en5747"> She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the Banking-house.</span><span id="en5748"> As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr.</span><span id="en5749"> Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5750"> To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.</span><span id="en5751"> He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head, and retained to his own occupations.</span><span id="en5752"> A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5753"> It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed.</span><span id="en5754"> He was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair.</span><span id="en5755"> In a few moments, a man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him, addressed him by his name.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5756"> "Your servant," said Mr.</span><span id="en5757"> Lorry.</span><span id="en5758"> "Do you know me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5759"> He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five to fifty years of age.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5760"> "Do you know me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5761"> "I have seen you somewhere."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5762"> "Perhaps at my wine-shop?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5763"> Much interested and agitated, Mr.</span><span id="en5764"> Lorry said: "You come from Doctor Manette?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5765"> "Yes.</span><span id="en5766"> I come from Doctor Manette."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5767"> "And what says he?</span><span id="en5768"> What does he send me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5769"> Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper.</span></p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"><span id="en5770">     "Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.</span><span id="en5771">      I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note     from Charles to his wife.</span><span id="en5772">   Let the bearer see his wife."</span></div>
<p><span id="en5773"> It was dated from La Force, within an hour.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5774"> "Will you accompany me," said Mr.</span><span id="en5775"> Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud, "to where his wife resides?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5776"> "Yes," returned Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5777"> Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke, Mr.</span><span id="en5778"> Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard.</span><span id="en5779"> There, they found two women; one, knitting.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5780"> "Madame Defarge, surely!"</span><span id="en5781"> said Mr.</span><span id="en5782"> Lorry, who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5783"> "It is she," observed her husband.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5784"> "Does Madame go with us?"</span><span id="en5785"> inquired Mr.</span><span id="en5786"> Lorry, seeing that she moved as they moved.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5787"> "Yes.</span><span id="en5788"> That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.</span><span id="en5789"> It is for their safety."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5790"> Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr.</span><span id="en5791"> Lorry looked dubiously at him, and led the way.</span><span id="en5792"> Both the women followed; the second woman being The Vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5793"> They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might, ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and found Lucie weeping, alone.</span><span id="en5794"> She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr.</span><span id="en5795"> Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that delivered his note—little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.</span></p>
<a id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-11_htm_html"></a><div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"><span id="en5796">      "DEAREST,—Take courage.</span><span id="en5797">   I am well, and your father has      influence around me.</span><span id="en5798">   You cannot answer this.</span><span id="en5799">       Kiss our child for me."</span></div>
<p><span id="en5800"> That was all the writing.</span><span id="en5801"> It was so much, however, to her who received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted.</span><span id="en5802"> It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response—dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5803"> There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check.</span><span id="en5804"> She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en5805"> Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5806"> "My dear," said Mr.</span><span id="en5807"> Lorry, striking in to explain; "there are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them—that she may identify them.</span><span id="en5808"> I believe," said Mr.</span><span id="en5809"> Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, "I state the case, Citizen Defarge?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5810"> Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5811"> "You had better, Lucie," said Mr.</span><span id="en5812"> Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, "have the dear child here, and our good Pross.</span><span id="en5813"> Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5814"> The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, "Well, I am sure, Boldface!</span><span id="en5815"> I hope you are pretty well!"</span><span id="en5816"> She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5817"> "Is that his child?"</span><span id="en5818"> said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5819"> "Yes, madame," answered Mr.</span><span id="en5820"> Lorry; "this is our poor prisoner's darling daughter, and only child."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5821"> The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast.</span><span id="en5822"> The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5823"> "It is enough, my husband," said Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en5824"> "I have seen them.</span><span id="en5825"> We may go."</span></p>

<p><span id="en5826"> "You will be good to my poor husband.</span><span id="en5827"> You will do him no harm.</span><span id="en5828"> You will help me to see him if you can?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5829"> "Your husband is not my business here," returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure.</span><span id="en5830"> "It is the daughter of your father who is my business here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5831"> "For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband.</span><span id="en5832"> For my child's sake!</span><span id="en5833"> She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful.</span><span id="en5834"> We are more afraid of you than of these others."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5835"> Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.</span><span id="en5836"> Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5837"> "What is it that your husband says in that little letter?"</span><span id="en5838"> asked Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile.</span><span id="en5839"> "Influence; he says something touching influence?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5840"> "That my father," said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, "has much influence around him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5841"> "Surely it will release him!"</span><span id="en5842"> said Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en5843"> "Let it do so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5844"> "As a wife and mother," cried Lucie, most earnestly, "I implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf.</span><span id="en5845"> O sister-woman, think of me.</span><span id="en5846"> As a wife and mother!"</span></p>

<p><span id="en5847"> "The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered?</span><span id="en5848"> We have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them, often enough?</span><span id="en5849"> All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5850"> "We have seen nothing else," returned The Vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5851"> "We have borne this a long time," said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes again upon Lucie.</span><span id="en5852"> "Judge you!</span><span id="en5853"> Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5854"> She resumed her knitting and went out.</span><span id="en5855"> The Vengeance followed.</span><span id="en5856"> Defarge went last, and closed the door.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5857"> "Courage, my dear Lucie," said Mr.</span><span id="en5858"> Lorry, as he raised her.</span><span id="en5859"> "Courage, courage!</span><span id="en5860"> So far all goes well with us—much, much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls.</span><span id="en5861"> Cheer up, and have a thankful heart."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5862"> "I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5863"> "Tut, tut!"</span><span id="en5864"> said Mr.</span><span id="en5865"> Lorry; "what is this despondency in the brave little breast?</span><span id="en5866"> A shadow indeed!</span><span id="en5867"> No substance in it, Lucie."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5868"> But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself, for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-11_htm_html_pgepubid00038">IV. Calm in Storm</h2>
<p><span id="en5869"> Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence.</span><span id="en5870"> So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain.</span><span id="en5871"> She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5872"> To Mr.</span><span id="en5873"> Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force.</span><span id="en5874"> That, in the prison he had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells.</span><span id="en5875"> That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this man was Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5876"> That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the Tribunal—of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not—for his life and liberty.</span><span id="en5877"> That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined.</span><span id="en5878"> That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference.</span><span id="en5879"> That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody.</span><span id="en5880"> That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5881"> The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold.</span><span id="en5882"> The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces.</span><span id="en5883"> One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out.</span><span id="en5884"> Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims.</span><span id="en5885"> With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude—had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot—had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5886"> As Mr.</span><span id="en5887"> Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5888"> But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never at all known him in his present character.</span><span id="en5889"> For the first time the Doctor felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power.</span><span id="en5890"> For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him.</span><span id="en5891"> "It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.</span><span id="en5892"> As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven I will do it!"</span><span id="en5893"> Thus, Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en5894"> And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5895"> Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering purpose.</span><span id="en5896"> While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force.</span><span id="en5897"> He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5898"> This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr.</span><span id="en5899"> Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.</span><span id="en5900"> Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity.</span><span id="en5901"> The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.</span><span id="en5902"> Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong.</span><span id="en5903"> The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him.</span><span id="en5904"> "All curious to see," thought Mr.</span><span id="en5905"> Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, "but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in better hands."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5906"> But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him.</span><span id="en5907"> The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.</span><span id="en5908"> What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty—the deluge rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!</span></p>
<p><span id="en5909"> There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time.</span><span id="en5910"> Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none.</span><span id="en5911"> Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient.</span><span id="en5912"> Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king—and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5913"> And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast.</span><span id="en5914"> A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.</span><span id="en5915"> Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world—the figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5916"> It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack.</span><span id="en5917"> It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race.</span><span id="en5918"> It superseded the Cross.</span><span id="en5919"> Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5920"> It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red.</span><span id="en5921"> It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it.</span><span id="en5922"> It hushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and good.</span><span id="en5923"> Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.</span><span id="en5924"> The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every day.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5925"> Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last.</span><span id="en5926"> Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident.</span><span id="en5927"> So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun.</span><span id="en5928"> Still, the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head.</span><span id="en5929"> No man better known than he, in Paris at that day; no man in a stranger situation.</span><span id="en5930"> Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims, he was a man apart.</span><span id="en5931"> In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men.</span><span id="en5932"> He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving among mortals.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-11_htm_html_pgepubid00039">V. The Wood-Sawyer</h2>
<p><span id="en5933"> One year and three months.</span><span id="en5934"> During all that time Lucie was never sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband's head next day.</span><span id="en5935"> Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned.</span><span id="en5936"> Lovely girls; bright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.</span><span id="en5937"> Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;—the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!</span></p>
<p><span id="en5938"> If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time, had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many.</span><span id="en5939"> But, from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties.</span><span id="en5940"> She was truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good will always be.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5941"> As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there.</span><span id="en5942"> Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time.</span><span id="en5943"> Little Lucie she taught, as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home.</span><span id="en5944"> The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited—the little preparations for his speedy return, the setting aside of his chair and his books—these, and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death—were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5945"> She did not greatly alter in appearance.</span><span id="en5946"> The plain dark dresses, akin to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days.</span><span id="en5947"> She lost her colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely.</span><span id="en5948"> Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven, was on him.</span><span id="en5949"> He always resolutely answered: "Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie."</span></p>

<p><span id="en5950"> "My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon.</span><span id="en5951"> When he can get to it—which depends on many uncertainties and incidents—he might see you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you.</span><span id="en5952"> But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5953"> "O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5954"> From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours.</span><span id="en5955"> As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.</span><span id="en5956"> When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5957"> It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street.</span><span id="en5958"> The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall.</span><span id="en5959"> On the third day of her being there, he noticed her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5960"> "Good day, citizeness."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5961"> "Good day, citizen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5962"> This mode of address was now prescribed by decree.</span><span id="en5963"> It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5964"> "Walking here again, citizeness?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5965"> "You see me, citizen!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5966"> The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars, peeped through them jocosely.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5967"> "But it's not my business," said he.</span><span id="en5968"> And went on sawing his wood.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5969"> Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she appeared.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5970"> "What?</span><span id="en5971"> Walking here again, citizeness?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5972"> "Yes, citizen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5973"> "Ah!</span><span id="en5974"> A child too!</span><span id="en5975"> Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5976"> "Do I say yes, mamma?"</span><span id="en5977"> whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5978"> "Yes, dearest."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5979"> "Yes, citizen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en5980"> "Ah!</span><span id="en5981"> But it's not my business.</span><span id="en5982"> My work is my business.</span><span id="en5983"> See my saw!</span><span id="en5984"> I call it my Little Guillotine.</span><span id="en5985"> La, la, la; La, la, la!</span><span id="en5986"> And off his head comes!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5987"> The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5988"> "I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine.</span><span id="en5989"> See here again!</span><span id="en5990"> Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo!</span><span id="en5991"> And off her head comes!</span><span id="en5992"> Now, a child.</span><span id="en5993"> Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle!</span><span id="en5994"> And off its head comes.</span><span id="en5995"> All the family!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en5996"> Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his sight.</span><span id="en5997"> Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.</span></p>
<p><span id="en5998"> He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work.</span><span id="en5999"> "But it's not my business!"</span><span id="en6000"> he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6001"> In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.</span><span id="en6002"> Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together.</span><span id="en6003"> It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6004"> These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head.</span><span id="en6005"> On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner.</span><span id="en6006"> It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival.</span><span id="en6007"> She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible.</span><span id="en6008"> Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!</span></p>
<p><span id="en6009"> The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend.</span><span id="en6010"> He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty.</span><span id="en6011"> On his house-top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his "Little Sainte Guillotine"—for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised.</span><span id="en6012"> His shop was shut and he was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6013"> But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear.</span><span id="en6014"> A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance.</span><span id="en6015"> There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing like five thousand demons.</span><span id="en6016"> There was no other music than their own singing.</span><span id="en6017"> They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.</span><span id="en6018"> Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced together, as hazard had brought them together.</span><span id="en6019"> At first, they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them.</span><span id="en6020"> They advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round in pairs, until many of them dropped.</span><span id="en6021"> While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way.</span><span id="en6022"> Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off.</span><span id="en6023"> No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance.</span><span id="en6024"> It was so emphatically a fallen sport—a something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry—a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the heart.</span><span id="en6025"> Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become.</span><span id="en6026"> The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6027"> This was the Carmagnole.</span><span id="en6028"> As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6029"> "O my father!"</span><span id="en6030"> for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand; "such a cruel, bad sight."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6031"> "I know, my dear, I know.</span><span id="en6032"> I have seen it many times.</span><span id="en6033"> Don't be frightened!</span><span id="en6034"> Not one of them would harm you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6035"> "I am not frightened for myself, my father.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6036"> "We will set him above their mercies very soon.</span><span id="en6037"> I left him climbing to the window, and I came to tell you.</span><span id="en6038"> There is no one here to see.</span><span id="en6039"> You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6040"> "I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6041"> "You cannot see him, my poor dear?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6042"> "No, father," said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand, "no."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6043"> A footstep in the snow.</span><span id="en6044"> Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en6045"> "I salute you, citizeness," from the Doctor.</span><span id="en6046"> "I salute you, citizen."</span><span id="en6047"> This in passing.</span><span id="en6048"> Nothing more.</span><span id="en6049"> Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6050"> "Give me your arm, my love.</span><span id="en6051"> Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake.</span><span id="en6052"> That was well done;" they had left the spot; "it shall not be in vain.</span><span id="en6053"> Charles is summoned for to-morrow."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6054"> "For to-morrow!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6055"> "There is no time to lose.</span><span id="en6056"> I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal.</span><span id="en6057"> He has not received the notice yet, but I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the Conciergerie; I have timely information.</span><span id="en6058"> You are not afraid?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6059"> She could scarcely answer, "I trust in you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6060"> "Do so, implicitly.</span><span id="en6061"> Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every protection.</span><span id="en6062"> I must see Lorry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6063"> He stopped.</span><span id="en6064"> There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing.</span><span id="en6065"> They both knew too well what it meant.</span><span id="en6066"> One.</span><span id="en6067"> Two.</span><span id="en6068"> Three.</span><span id="en6069"> Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6070"> "I must see Lorry," the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6071"> The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it.</span><span id="en6072"> He and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national.</span><span id="en6073"> What he could save for the owners, he saved.</span><span id="en6074"> No better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to hold his peace.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6075"> A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness.</span><span id="en6076"> It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank.</span><span id="en6077"> The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted.</span><span id="en6078"> Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property.</span><span id="en6079"> Republic One and Indivisible.</span><span id="en6080"> Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!</span></p>
<p><span id="en6081"> Who could that be with Mr.</span><span id="en6082"> Lorry—the owner of the riding-coat upon the chair—who must not be seen?</span><span id="en6083"> From whom newly arrived, did he come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms?</span><span id="en6084"> To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued, he said: "Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?"</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-11_htm_html_pgepubid00040">VI. Triumph</h2>
<p><span id="en6085"> The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day.</span><span id="en6086"> Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners.</span><span id="en6087"> The standard gaoler-joke was, "Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6088"> "Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6089"> So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6090"> When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded.</span><span id="en6091"> Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away so.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6092"> His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name.</span><span id="en6093"> There were twenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten.</span><span id="en6094"> The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival.</span><span id="en6095"> Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6096"> There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over.</span><span id="en6097"> It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening.</span><span id="en6098"> They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night.</span><span id="en6099"> The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time.</span><span id="en6100"> Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind.</span><span id="en6101"> In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease—a terrible passing inclination to die of it.</span><span id="en6102"> And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6103"> The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold.</span><span id="en6104"> Next day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called.</span><span id="en6105"> All the fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6106"> "Charles Evremonde, called Darnay," was at length arraigned.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6107"> His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing.</span><span id="en6108"> Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men.</span><span id="en6109"> The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check.</span><span id="en6110"> Of the men, the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted.</span><span id="en6111"> Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked.</span><span id="en6112"> She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly remembered as Defarge.</span><span id="en6113"> He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be, they never looked towards him.</span><span id="en6114"> They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at the Jury, but at nothing else.</span><span id="en6115"> Under the President sat Doctor Manette, in his usual quiet dress.</span><span id="en6116"> As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.</span><span id="en6117"> Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6118"> Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death.</span><span id="en6119"> It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France.</span><span id="en6120"> There he was, and there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6121"> "Take off his head!"</span><span id="en6122"> cried the audience.</span><span id="en6123"> "An enemy to the Republic!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6124"> The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6125"> Undoubtedly it was.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6126"> Was he not an emigrant then?</span><span id="en6127"> What did he call himself?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6128"> Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6129"> Why not?</span><span id="en6130"> the President desired to know.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6131"> Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country—he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in use—to live by his own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6132"> What proof had he of this?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6133"> He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6134"> But he had married in England?</span><span id="en6135"> the President reminded him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6136"> True, but not an English woman.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6137"> A citizeness of France?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6138"> Yes.</span><span id="en6139"> By birth.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6140"> Her name and family?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6141"> "Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6142"> This answer had a happy effect upon the audience.</span><span id="en6143"> Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall.</span><span id="en6144"> So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6145"> On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions.</span><span id="en6146"> The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6147"> The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not sooner?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6148"> He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.</span><span id="en6149"> He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his absence.</span><span id="en6150"> He had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth.</span><span id="en6151"> Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6152"> The populace cried enthusiastically, "No!"</span><span id="en6153"> and the President rang his bell to quiet them.</span><span id="en6154"> Which it did not, for they continued to cry "No!"</span><span id="en6155"> until they left off, of their own will.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6156"> The President required the name of that citizen.</span><span id="en6157"> The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness.</span><span id="en6158"> He also referred with confidence to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6159"> The Doctor had taken care that it should be there—had assured him that it would be there—and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read.</span><span id="en6160"> Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so.</span><span id="en6161"> Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye—in fact, had rather passed out of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance—until three days ago; when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called Darnay.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6162"> Doctor Manette was next questioned.</span><span id="en6163"> His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States—as he brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one.</span><span id="en6164"> At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6165"> At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause.</span><span id="en6166"> All the voices were in the prisoner's favour, and the President declared him free.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6167"> Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage.</span><span id="en6168"> No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating.</span><span id="en6169"> No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6170"> His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment.</span><span id="en6171"> Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed.</span><span id="en6172"> So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours.</span><span id="en6173"> The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign of Death—a raised finger—and they all added in words, "Long live the Republic!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6174"> The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Court—except two, for which he looked in vain.</span><span id="en6175"> On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6176"> They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.</span><span id="en6177"> Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top.</span><span id="en6178"> In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6179"> In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on.</span><span id="en6180"> Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived.</span><span id="en6181"> Her father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6182"> As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing.</span><span id="en6183"> Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.</span><span id="en6184"> Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6185"> After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him; after grasping the hand of Mr.</span><span id="en6186"> Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6187"> "Lucie!</span><span id="en6188"> My own!</span><span id="en6189"> I am safe."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6190"> "O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6191"> They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6192"> "And now speak to your father, dearest.</span><span id="en6193"> No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6194"> She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor head on her own breast, long, long ago.</span><span id="en6195"> He was happy in the return he had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his strength.</span><span id="en6196"> "You must not be weak, my darling," he remonstrated; "don't tremble so.</span><span id="en6197"> I have saved him."</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-12_htm_html_pgepubid00041">VII. A Knock at the Door</h2>
<p><span id="en6198"> "I have saved him."</span><span id="en6199"> It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here.</span><span id="en6200"> And yet his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6201"> All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.</span><span id="en6202"> The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets.</span><span id="en6203"> Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6204"> Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see.</span><span id="en6205"> No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now!</span><span id="en6206"> He had accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles.</span><span id="en6207"> Let them all lean upon him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6208"> Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners.</span><span id="en6209"> Partly on this account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr.</span><span id="en6210"> Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6211"> It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground.</span><span id="en6212"> Mr.</span><span id="en6213"> Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called Darnay.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6214"> In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed.</span><span id="en6215"> In the Doctor's little household, as in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops.</span><span id="en6216"> To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6217"> For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr.</span><span id="en6218"> Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket.</span><span id="en6219"> Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such purchases as were needful.</span><span id="en6220"> Although Miss Pross, through her long association with a French family, might have known as much of their language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that direction; consequently she knew no more of that "nonsense" (as she was pleased to call it) than Mr.</span><span id="en6221"> Cruncher did.</span><span id="en6222"> So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded.</span><span id="en6223"> She always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6224"> "Now, Mr.</span><span id="en6225"> Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity; "if you are ready, I am."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6226"> Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service.</span><span id="en6227"> He had worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6228"> "There's all manner of things wanted," said Miss Pross, "and we shall have a precious time of it.</span><span id="en6229"> We want wine, among the rest.</span><span id="en6230"> Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6231"> "It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think," retorted Jerry, "whether they drink your health or the Old Un's."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6232"> "Who's he?"</span><span id="en6233"> said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6234"> Mr.</span><span id="en6235"> Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning "Old Nick's."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6236"> "Ha!"</span><span id="en6237"> said Miss Pross, "it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures.</span><span id="en6238"> They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder, and Mischief."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6239"> "Hush, dear!</span><span id="en6240"> Pray, pray, be cautious!"</span><span id="en6241"> cried Lucie.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6242"> "Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious," said Miss Pross; "but I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets.</span><span id="en6243"> Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!</span><span id="en6244"> Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!</span><span id="en6245"> May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6246"> "I think you may take that liberty," the Doctor answered, smiling.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6247"> "For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of that," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6248"> "Hush, dear!</span><span id="en6249"> Again?"</span><span id="en6250"> Lucie remonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6251"> "Well, my sweet," said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, "the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;" Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; "and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6252"> Mr.</span><span id="en6253"> Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6254"> "I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice," said Miss Pross, approvingly.</span><span id="en6255"> "But the question, Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en6256"> Is there"—it was the good creature's way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner—"is there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6257"> "I fear not yet.</span><span id="en6258"> It would be dangerous for Charles yet."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6259"> "Heigh-ho-hum!"</span><span id="en6260"> said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, "then we must have patience and wait: that's all.</span><span id="en6261"> We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say.</span><span id="en6262"> Now, Mr.</span><span id="en6263"> Cruncher!</span><span id="en6264"> —Don't you move, Ladybird!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6265"> They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire.</span><span id="en6266"> Mr.</span><span id="en6267"> Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House.</span><span id="en6268"> Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed.</span><span id="en6269"> Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he, in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service.</span><span id="en6270"> All was subdued and quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6271"> "What is that?"</span><span id="en6272"> she cried, all at once.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6273"> "My dear!"</span><span id="en6274"> said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand on hers, "command yourself.</span><span id="en6275"> What a disordered state you are in!</span><span id="en6276"> The least thing—nothing—startles you!</span><span id="en6277"> You, your father's daughter!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6278"> "I thought, my father," said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face and in a faltering voice, "that I heard strange feet upon the stairs."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6279"> "My love, the staircase is as still as Death."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6280"> As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6281"> "Oh father, father.</span><span id="en6282"> What can this be!</span><span id="en6283"> Hide Charles.</span><span id="en6284"> Save him!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6285"> "My child," said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, "I have saved him.</span><span id="en6286"> What weakness is this, my dear!</span><span id="en6287"> Let me go to the door."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6288"> He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms, and opened it.</span><span id="en6289"> A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6290"> "The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay," said the first.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6291"> "Who seeks him?"</span><span id="en6292"> answered Darnay.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6293"> "I seek him.</span><span id="en6294"> We seek him.</span><span id="en6295"> I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the Tribunal to-day.</span><span id="en6296"> You are again the prisoner of the Republic."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6297"> The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6298"> "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6299"> "It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will know to-morrow.</span><span id="en6300"> You are summoned for to-morrow."</span></p>

<p><span id="en6301"> "You know him, you have said.</span><span id="en6302"> Do you know me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6303"> "Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6304"> "We all know you, Citizen Doctor," said the other three.</span></p>

<p><span id="en6305"> "Will you answer his question to me then?</span><span id="en6306"> How does this happen?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6307"> "Citizen Doctor," said the first, reluctantly, "he has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine.</span><span id="en6308"> This citizen," pointing out the second who had entered, "is from Saint Antoine."</span></p>

<p><span id="en6309"> "He is accused by Saint Antoine."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6310"> "Of what?"</span><span id="en6311"> asked the Doctor.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6312"> "Citizen Doctor," said the first, with his former reluctance, "ask no more.</span><span id="en6313"> If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them.</span><span id="en6314"> The Republic goes before all.</span><span id="en6315"> The People is supreme.</span><span id="en6316"> Evremonde, we are pressed."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6317"> "One word," the Doctor entreated.</span><span id="en6318"> "Will you tell me who denounced him?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6319"> "It is against rule," answered the first; "but you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6320"> The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6321"> "Well!</span><span id="en6322"> Truly it is against rule.</span><span id="en6323"> But he is denounced—and gravely—by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge.</span><span id="en6324"> And by one other."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6325"> "What other?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6326"> "Do you ask, Citizen Doctor?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6327"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6328"> "Then," said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, "you will be answered to-morrow.</span><span id="en6329"> Now, I am dumb!"</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-12_htm_html_pgepubid00042">VIII. A Hand at Cards</h2>
<p><span id="en6330"> Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make.</span><span id="en6331"> Mr.</span><span id="en6332"> Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side.</span><span id="en6333"> They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers.</span><span id="en6334"> It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the Republic.</span><span id="en6335"> Woe to the man who played tricks with that Army, or got undeserved promotion in it!</span><span id="en6336"> Better for him that his beard had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6337"> Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.</span><span id="en6338"> After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace, once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her fancy.</span><span id="en6339"> It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as the rest.</span><span id="en6340"> Sounding Mr.</span><span id="en6341"> Cruncher, and finding him of her opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by her cavalier.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6342"> Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6343"> As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a corner, and rose to depart.</span><span id="en6344"> In going, he had to face Miss Pross.</span><span id="en6345"> No sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her hands.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6346"> In a moment, the whole company were on their feet.</span><span id="en6347"> That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence.</span><span id="en6348"> Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman, evidently English.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6349"> What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears.</span><span id="en6350"> But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise.</span><span id="en6351"> For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr.</span><span id="en6352"> Cruncher—though it seemed on his own separate and individual account—was in a state of the greatest wonder.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6353"> "What is the matter?"</span><span id="en6354"> said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in English.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6355"> "Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!"</span><span id="en6356"> cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.</span><span id="en6357"> "After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6358"> "Don't call me Solomon.</span><span id="en6359"> Do you want to be the death of me?"</span><span id="en6360"> asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6361"> "Brother, brother!"</span><span id="en6362"> cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears.</span><span id="en6363"> "Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6364"> "Then hold your meddlesome tongue," said Solomon, "and come out, if you want to speak to me.</span><span id="en6365"> Pay for your wine, and come out.</span><span id="en6366"> Who's this man?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6367"> Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears, "Mr.</span><span id="en6368"> Cruncher."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6369"> "Let him come out too," said Solomon.</span><span id="en6370"> "Does he think me a ghost?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6371"> Apparently, Mr.</span><span id="en6372"> Cruncher did, to judge from his looks.</span><span id="en6373"> He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine.</span><span id="en6374"> As she did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6375"> "Now," said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, "what do you want?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6376"> "How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!"</span><span id="en6377"> cried Miss Pross, "to give me such a greeting, and show me no affection."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6378"> "There.</span><span id="en6379"> Confound it!</span><span id="en6380"> There," said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's lips with his own.</span><span id="en6381"> "Now are you content?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6382"> Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6383"> "If you expect me to be surprised," said her brother Solomon, "I am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here.</span><span id="en6384"> If you really don't want to endanger my existence—which I half believe you do—go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine.</span><span id="en6385"> I am busy.</span><span id="en6386"> I am an official."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6387"> "My English brother Solomon," mourned Miss Pross, casting up her tear-fraught eyes, "that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and such foreigners!</span></p>
<p><span id="en6388"> "I said so!"</span><span id="en6389"> cried her brother, interrupting.</span><span id="en6390"> "I knew it.</span><span id="en6391"> You want to be the death of me.</span><span id="en6392"> I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister.</span><span id="en6393"> Just as I am getting on!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6394"> "The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!"</span><span id="en6395"> cried Miss Pross.</span><span id="en6396"> "Far rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever loved you truly, and ever shall.</span><span id="en6397"> Say but one affectionate word to me, and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will detain you no longer."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6398"> Good Miss Pross!</span><span id="en6399"> As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers.</span><span id="en6400"> As if Mr.</span><span id="en6401"> Lorry had not known it for a fact, years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent her money and left her!</span></p>
<p><span id="en6402"> He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6403"> "I say!</span><span id="en6404"> Might I ask the favour?</span><span id="en6405"> As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6406"> The official turned towards him with sudden distrust.</span><span id="en6407"> He had not previously uttered a word.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6408"> "Come!"</span><span id="en6409"> said Mr.</span><span id="en6410"> Cruncher.</span><span id="en6411"> "Speak out, you know."</span><span id="en6412"> (Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.</span><span id="en6413"> ) "John Solomon, or Solomon John?</span><span id="en6414"> She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister.</span><span id="en6415"> And I know you're John, you know.</span><span id="en6416"> Which of the two goes first?</span><span id="en6417"> And regarding that name of Pross, likewise.</span><span id="en6418"> That warn't your name over the water."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6419"> "What do you mean?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6420"> "Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name was, over the water."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6421"> "No?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6422"> "No.</span><span id="en6423"> But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6424"> "Indeed?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6425"> "Yes.</span><span id="en6426"> T'other one's was one syllable.</span><span id="en6427"> I know you.</span><span id="en6428"> You was a spy—witness at the Bailey.</span><span id="en6429"> What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6430"> "Barsad," said another voice, striking in.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6431"> "That's the name for a thousand pound!"</span><span id="en6432"> cried Jerry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6433"> The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton.</span><span id="en6434"> He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr.</span><span id="en6435"> Cruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6436"> "Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross.</span><span id="en6437"> I arrived at Mr.</span><span id="en6438"> Lorry's, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother.</span><span id="en6439"> I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr.</span><span id="en6440"> Barsad.</span><span id="en6441"> I wish for your sake Mr.</span><span id="en6442"> Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6443"> Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6444"> "I'll tell you," said Sydney.</span><span id="en6445"> "I lighted on you, Mr.</span><span id="en6446"> Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago.</span><span id="en6447"> You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well.</span><span id="en6448"> Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction.</span><span id="en6449"> I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you.</span><span id="en6450"> I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling.</span><span id="en6451"> And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr.</span><span id="en6452"> Barsad."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6453"> "What purpose?"</span><span id="en6454"> the spy asked.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6455"> "It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street.</span><span id="en6456"> Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your company—at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6457"> "Under a threat?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6458"> "Oh!</span><span id="en6459"> Did I say that?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6460"> "Then, why should I go there?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6461"> "Really, Mr.</span><span id="en6462"> Barsad, I can't say, if you can't."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6463"> "Do you mean that you won't say, sir?"</span><span id="en6464"> the spy irresolutely asked.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6465"> "You apprehend me very clearly, Mr.</span><span id="en6466"> Barsad.</span><span id="en6467"> I won't."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6468"> Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind, and with such a man as he had to do with.</span><span id="en6469"> His practised eye saw it, and made the most of it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6470"> "Now, I told you so," said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his sister; "if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6471"> "Come, come, Mr.</span><span id="en6472"> Barsad!"</span><span id="en6473"> exclaimed Sydney.</span><span id="en6474"> "Don't be ungrateful.</span><span id="en6475"> But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction.</span><span id="en6476"> Do you go with me to the Bank?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6477"> "I'll hear what you have got to say.</span><span id="en6478"> Yes, I'll go with you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6479"> "I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street.</span><span id="en6480"> Let me take your arm, Miss Pross.</span><span id="en6481"> This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr.</span><span id="en6482"> Barsad, I will invite him to Mr.</span><span id="en6483"> Lorry's with us.</span><span id="en6484"> Are we ready?</span><span id="en6485"> Come then!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6486"> Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man.</span><span id="en6487"> She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she observed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6488"> They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.</span><span id="en6489"> Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk.</span><span id="en6490"> John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6491"> Mr.</span><span id="en6492"> Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire—perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago.</span><span id="en6493"> He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6494"> "Miss Pross's brother, sir," said Sydney.</span><span id="en6495"> "Mr.</span><span id="en6496"> Barsad."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6497"> "Barsad?"</span><span id="en6498"> repeated the old gentleman, "Barsad?</span><span id="en6499"> I have an association with the name—and with the face."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6500"> "I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr.</span><span id="en6501"> Barsad," observed Carton, coolly.</span><span id="en6502"> "Pray sit down."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6503"> As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr.</span><span id="en6504"> Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, "Witness at that trial."</span><span id="en6505"> Mr.</span><span id="en6506"> Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6507"> "Mr.</span><span id="en6508"> Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of," said Sydney, "and has acknowledged the relationship.</span><span id="en6509"> I pass to worse news.</span><span id="en6510"> Darnay has been arrested again."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6511"> Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, "What do you tell me!</span><span id="en6512"> I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6513"> "Arrested for all that.</span><span id="en6514"> When was it done, Mr.</span><span id="en6515"> Barsad?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6516"> "Just now, if at all."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6517"> "Mr.</span><span id="en6518"> Barsad is the best authority possible, sir," said Sydney, "and I have it from Mr.</span><span id="en6519"> Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place.</span><span id="en6520"> He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter.</span><span id="en6521"> There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6522"> Mr.</span><span id="en6523"> Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point.</span><span id="en6524"> Confused, but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was silently attentive.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6525"> "Now, I trust," said Sydney to him, "that the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow—you said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr.</span><span id="en6526"> Barsad?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6527"> "Yes; I believe so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6528"> "—In as good stead to-morrow as to-day.</span><span id="en6529"> But it may not be so.</span><span id="en6530"> I own to you, I am shaken, Mr.</span><span id="en6531"> Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the power to prevent this arrest."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6532"> "He may not have known of it beforehand," said Mr.</span><span id="en6533"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6534"> "But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6535"> "That's true," Mr.</span><span id="en6536"> Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6537"> "In short," said Sydney, "this is a desperate time, when desperate games are played for desperate stakes.</span><span id="en6538"> Let the Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one.</span><span id="en6539"> No man's life here is worth purchase.</span><span id="en6540"> Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow.</span><span id="en6541"> Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie.</span><span id="en6542"> And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.</span><span id="en6543"> Barsad."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6544"> "You need have good cards, sir," said the spy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6545"> "I'll run them over.</span><span id="en6546"> I'll see what I hold,—Mr.</span><span id="en6547"> Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6548"> It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful—drank off another glassful—pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6549"> "Mr.</span><span id="en6550"> Barsad," he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: "Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.</span><span id="en6551"> That's a very good card.</span><span id="en6552"> Mr.</span><span id="en6553"> Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom.</span><span id="en6554"> That's an excellent card.</span><span id="en6555"> Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.</span><span id="en6556"> Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find.</span><span id="en6557"> That's a card not to be beaten.</span><span id="en6558"> Have you followed my hand, Mr.</span><span id="en6559"> Barsad?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6560"> "Not to understand your play," returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6561"> "I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr.</span><span id="en6562"> Barsad to the nearest Section Committee.</span><span id="en6563"> Look over your hand, Mr.</span><span id="en6564"> Barsad, and see what you have.</span><span id="en6565"> Don't hurry."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6566"> He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off.</span><span id="en6567"> He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him.</span><span id="en6568"> Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6569"> "Look over your hand carefully, Mr.</span><span id="en6570"> Barsad.</span><span id="en6571"> Take time."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6572"> It was a poorer hand than he suspected.</span><span id="en6573"> Mr.</span><span id="en6574"> Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of.</span><span id="en6575"> Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there—not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date—he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives.</span><span id="en6576"> He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally.</span><span id="en6577"> He always remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.</span><span id="en6578"> He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up.</span><span id="en6579"> He knew, as every one employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him.</span><span id="en6580"> Once denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash his last chance of life.</span><span id="en6581"> Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6582"> "You scarcely seem to like your hand," said Sydney, with the greatest composure.</span><span id="en6583"> "Do you play?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6584"> "I think, sir," said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.</span><span id="en6585"> Lorry, "I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken.</span><span id="en6586"> I admit that I am a spy, and that it is considered a discreditable station—though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6587"> "I play my Ace, Mr.</span><span id="en6588"> Barsad," said Carton, taking the answer on himself, and looking at his watch, "without any scruple, in a very few minutes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6589"> "I should have hoped, gentlemen both," said the spy, always striving to hook Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6590"> "I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother," said Sydney Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6591"> "You think not, sir?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6592"> "I have thoroughly made up my mind about it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6593"> The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,—who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he,—that it faltered here and failed him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6594"> "And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I have another good card here, not yet enumerated.</span><span id="en6595"> That friend and fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons; who was he?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6596"> "French.</span><span id="en6597"> You don't know him," said the spy, quickly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6598"> "French, eh?"</span><span id="en6599"> repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him at all, though he echoed his word.</span><span id="en6600"> "Well; he may be."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6601"> "Is, I assure you," said the spy; "though it's not important."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6602"> "Though it's not important," repeated Carton, in the same mechanical way—"though it's not important—No, it's not important.</span><span id="en6603"> No.</span><span id="en6604"> Yet I know the face."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6605"> "I think not.</span><span id="en6606"> I am sure not.</span><span id="en6607"> It can't be," said the spy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6608"> "It-can't-be," muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again.</span><span id="en6609"> "Can't-be.</span><span id="en6610"> Spoke good French.</span><span id="en6611"> Yet like a foreigner, I thought?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6612"> "Provincial," said the spy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6613"> "No.</span><span id="en6614"> Foreign!"</span><span id="en6615"> cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a light broke clearly on his mind.</span><span id="en6616"> "Cly!</span><span id="en6617"> Disguised, but the same man.</span><span id="en6618"> We had that man before us at the Old Bailey."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6619"> "Now, there you are hasty, sir," said Barsad, with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; "there you really give me an advantage over you.</span><span id="en6620"> Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years.</span><span id="en6621"> I attended him in his last illness.</span><span id="en6622"> He was buried in London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields.</span><span id="en6623"> His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6624"> Here, Mr.</span><span id="en6625"> Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall.</span><span id="en6626"> Tracing it to its source, he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr.</span><span id="en6627"> Cruncher's head.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6628"> "Let us be reasonable," said the spy, "and let us be fair.</span><span id="en6629"> To show you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book," with a hurried hand he produced and opened it, "ever since.</span><span id="en6630"> There it is.</span><span id="en6631"> Oh, look at it, look at it!</span><span id="en6632"> You may take it in your hand; it's no forgery."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6633"> Here, Mr.</span><span id="en6634"> Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and Mr.</span><span id="en6635"> Cruncher rose and stepped forward.</span><span id="en6636"> His hair could not have been more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6637"> Unseen by the spy, Mr.</span><span id="en6638"> Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6639"> "That there Roger Cly, master," said Mr.</span><span id="en6640"> Cruncher, with a taciturn and iron-bound visage.</span><span id="en6641"> "So you put him in his coffin?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6642"> "I did."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6643"> "Who took him out of it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6644"> Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, "What do you mean?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6645"> "I mean," said Mr.</span><span id="en6646"> Cruncher, "that he warn't never in it.</span><span id="en6647"> No!</span><span id="en6648"> Not he!</span><span id="en6649"> I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6650"> The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6651"> "I tell you," said Jerry, "that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin.</span><span id="en6652"> Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly.</span><span id="en6653"> It was a take in.</span><span id="en6654"> Me and two more knows it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6655"> "How do you know it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6656"> "What's that to you?</span><span id="en6657"> Ecod!"</span><span id="en6658"> growled Mr.</span><span id="en6659"> Cruncher, "it's you I have got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!</span><span id="en6660"> I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6661"> Sydney Carton, who, with Mr.</span><span id="en6662"> Lorry, had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business, here requested Mr.</span><span id="en6663"> Cruncher to moderate and explain himself.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6664"> "At another time, sir," he returned, evasively, "the present time is ill-conwenient for explainin'.</span><span id="en6665"> What I stand to, is, that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin.</span><span id="en6666"> Let him say he was, in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;" Mr.</span><span id="en6667"> Cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer; "or I'll out and announce him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6668"> "Humph!</span><span id="en6669"> I see one thing," said Carton.</span><span id="en6670"> "I hold another card, Mr.</span><span id="en6671"> Barsad.</span><span id="en6672"> Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!</span><span id="en6673"> A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic.</span><span id="en6674"> A strong card—a certain Guillotine card!</span><span id="en6675"> Do you play?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6676"> "No!"</span><span id="en6677"> returned the spy.</span><span id="en6678"> "I throw up.</span><span id="en6679"> I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham.</span><span id="en6680"> Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6681"> "Never you trouble your head about this man," retorted the contentious Mr.</span><span id="en6682"> Cruncher; "you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman.</span><span id="en6683"> And look here!</span><span id="en6684"> Once more!"</span><span id="en6685"> —Mr.</span><span id="en6686"> Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberality—"I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6687"> The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said, with more decision, "It has come to a point.</span><span id="en6688"> I go on duty soon, and can't overstay my time.</span><span id="en6689"> You told me you had a proposal; what is it?</span><span id="en6690"> Now, it is of no use asking too much of me.</span><span id="en6691"> Ask me to do anything in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent.</span><span id="en6692"> In short, I should make that choice.</span><span id="en6693"> You talk of desperation.</span><span id="en6694"> We are all desperate here.</span><span id="en6695"> Remember!</span><span id="en6696"> I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others.</span><span id="en6697"> Now, what do you want with me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6698"> "Not very much.</span><span id="en6699"> You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6700"> "I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible," said the spy, firmly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6701"> "Why need you tell me what I have not asked?</span><span id="en6702"> You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6703"> "I am sometimes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6704"> "You can be when you choose?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6705"> "I can pass in and out when I choose."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6706"> Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6707"> "So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me.</span><span id="en6708"> Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone."</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-12_htm_html_pgepubid00043">IX. The Game Made</h2>
<p><span id="en6709"> While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr.</span><span id="en6710"> Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust.</span><span id="en6711"> That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr.</span><span id="en6712"> Lorry's eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6713"> "Jerry," said Mr.</span><span id="en6714"> Lorry.</span><span id="en6715"> "Come here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6716"> Mr.</span><span id="en6717"> Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6718"> "What have you been, besides a messenger?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6719"> After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr.</span><span id="en6720"> Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, "Agicultooral character."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6721"> "My mind misgives me much," said Mr.</span><span id="en6722"> Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger at him, "that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description.</span><span id="en6723"> If you have, don't expect me to befriend you when you get back to England.</span><span id="en6724"> If you have, don't expect me to keep your secret.</span><span id="en6725"> Tellson's shall not be imposed upon."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6726"> "I hope, sir," pleaded the abashed Mr.</span><span id="en6727"> Cruncher, "that a gentleman like yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it, would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so—I don't say it is, but even if it wos.</span><span id="en6728"> And which it is to be took into account that if it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side.</span><span id="en6729"> There'd be two sides to it.</span><span id="en6730"> There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his fardens—fardens!</span><span id="en6731"> no, nor yet his half fardens—half fardens!</span><span id="en6732"> no, nor yet his quarter—a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to their own carriages—ah!</span><span id="en6733"> equally like smoke, if not more so.</span><span id="en6734"> Well, that 'ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's.</span><span id="en6735"> For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander.</span><span id="en6736"> And here's Mrs.</span><span id="en6737"> Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating—stark ruinating!</span><span id="en6738"> Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop—catch 'em at it!</span><span id="en6739"> Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly have one without t'other?</span><span id="en6740"> Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get much by it, even if it wos so.</span><span id="en6741"> And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him, Mr.</span><span id="en6742"> Lorry.</span><span id="en6743"> He'd never have no good of it; he'd want all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being once in—even if it wos so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6744"> "Ugh!"</span><span id="en6745"> cried Mr.</span><span id="en6746"> Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, "I am shocked at the sight of you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6747"> "Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir," pursued Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6748"> "Don't prevaricate," said Mr.</span><span id="en6749"> Lorry.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6750"> "No, I will not, sir," returned Mr.</span><span id="en6751"> Crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice—"which I don't say it is—wot I would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this.</span><span id="en6752"> Upon that there stool, at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes.</span><span id="en6753"> If it wos so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to you, sir), let that there boy keep his father's place, and take care of his mother; don't blow upon that boy's father—do not do it, sir—and let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends for what he would have undug—if it wos so—by diggin' of 'em in with a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe.</span><span id="en6754"> That, Mr.</span><span id="en6755"> Lorry," said Mr.</span><span id="en6756"> Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, "is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir.</span><span id="en6757"> A man don't see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of things.</span><span id="en6758"> And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep' it back."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6759"> "That at least is true," said Mr.</span><span id="en6760"> Lorry.</span><span id="en6761"> "Say no more now.</span><span id="en6762"> It may be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in action—not in words.</span><span id="en6763"> I want no more words."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6764"> Mr.</span><span id="en6765"> Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room.</span><span id="en6766"> "Adieu, Mr.</span><span id="en6767"> Barsad," said the former; "our arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6768"> He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr.</span><span id="en6769"> Lorry.</span><span id="en6770"> When they were alone, Mr.</span><span id="en6771"> Lorry asked him what he had done?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6772"> "Not much.</span><span id="en6773"> If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access to him, once."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6774"> Mr.</span><span id="en6775"> Lorry's countenance fell.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6776"> "It is all I could do," said Carton.</span><span id="en6777"> "To propose too much, would be to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced.</span><span id="en6778"> It was obviously the weakness of the position.</span><span id="en6779"> There is no help for it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6780"> "But access to him," said Mr.</span><span id="en6781"> Lorry, "if it should go ill before the Tribunal, will not save him."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6782"> "I never said it would."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6783"> Mr.</span><span id="en6784"> Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears fell.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6785"> "You are a good man and a true friend," said Carton, in an altered voice.</span><span id="en6786"> "Forgive me if I notice that you are affected.</span><span id="en6787"> I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless.</span><span id="en6788"> And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father.</span><span id="en6789"> You are free from that misfortune, however."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6790"> Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that Mr.</span><span id="en6791"> Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for.</span><span id="en6792"> He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6793"> "To return to poor Darnay," said Carton.</span><span id="en6794"> "Don't tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement.</span><span id="en6795"> It would not enable Her to go to see him.</span><span id="en6796"> She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6797"> Mr.</span><span id="en6798"> Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind.</span><span id="en6799"> It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6800"> "She might think a thousand things," Carton said, "and any of them would only add to her trouble.</span><span id="en6801"> Don't speak of me to her.</span><span id="en6802"> As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her.</span><span id="en6803"> I can put my hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.</span><span id="en6804"> You are going to her, I hope?</span><span id="en6805"> She must be very desolate to-night."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6806"> "I am going now, directly."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6807"> "I am glad of that.</span><span id="en6808"> She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you.</span><span id="en6809"> How does she look?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6810"> "Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6811"> "Ah!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6812"> It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh—almost like a sob.</span><span id="en6813"> It attracted Mr.</span><span id="en6814"> Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the fire.</span><span id="en6815"> A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which), passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward.</span><span id="en6816"> He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him.</span><span id="en6817"> His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr.</span><span id="en6818"> Lorry; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his foot.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6819"> "I forgot it," he said.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6820"> Mr.</span><span id="en6821"> Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face.</span><span id="en6822"> Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly reminded of that expression.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6823"> "And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?"</span><span id="en6824"> said Carton, turning to him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6825"> "Yes.</span><span id="en6826"> As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here.</span><span id="en6827"> I hoped to have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris.</span><span id="en6828"> I have my Leave to Pass.</span><span id="en6829"> I was ready to go."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6830"> They were both silent.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6831"> "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?"</span><span id="en6832"> said Carton, wistfully.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6833"> "I am in my seventy-eighth year."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6834"> "You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6835"> "I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man.</span><span id="en6836"> Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6837"> "See what a place you fill at seventy-eight.</span><span id="en6838"> How many people will miss you when you leave it empty!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6839"> "A solitary old bachelor," answered Mr.</span><span id="en6840"> Lorry, shaking his head.</span><span id="en6841"> "There is nobody to weep for me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6842"> "How can you say that?</span><span id="en6843"> Wouldn't She weep for you?</span><span id="en6844"> Wouldn't her child?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6845"> "Yes, yes, thank God.</span><span id="en6846"> I didn't quite mean what I said."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6847"> "It is a thing to thank God for; is it not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6848"> "Surely, surely."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6849"> "If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, 'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!</span><span id="en6850"> ' your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6851"> "You say truly, Mr.</span><span id="en6852"> Carton; I think they would be."</span></p>

<p><span id="en6853"> "I should like to ask you:—Does your childhood seem far off?</span><span id="en6854"> Do the days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6855"> Responding to his softened manner, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6856"> "Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no.</span><span id="en6857"> For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning.</span><span id="en6858"> It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way.</span><span id="en6859"> My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!</span><span id="en6860"> ), and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6861"> "I understand the feeling!"</span><span id="en6862"> exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush.</span><span id="en6863"> "And you are the better for it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6864"> "I hope so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6865"> Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with his outer coat; "But you," said Mr.</span><span id="en6866"> Lorry, reverting to the theme, "you are young."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6867"> "Yes," said Carton.</span><span id="en6868"> "I am not old, but my young way was never the way to age.</span><span id="en6869"> Enough of me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6870"> "And of me, I am sure," said Mr.</span><span id="en6871"> Lorry.</span><span id="en6872"> "Are you going out?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6873"> "I'll walk with you to her gate.</span><span id="en6874"> You know my vagabond and restless habits.</span><span id="en6875"> If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning.</span><span id="en6876"> You go to the Court to-morrow?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6877"> "Yes, unhappily."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6878"> "I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd.</span><span id="en6879"> My Spy will find a place for me.</span><span id="en6880"> Take my arm, sir."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6881"> Mr.</span><span id="en6882"> Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets.</span><span id="en6883"> A few minutes brought them to Mr.</span><span id="en6884"> Lorry's destination.</span><span id="en6885"> Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it.</span><span id="en6886"> He had heard of her going to the prison every day.</span><span id="en6887"> "She came out here," he said, looking about him, "turned this way, must have trod on these stones often.</span><span id="en6888"> Let me follow in her steps."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6889"> It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, where she had stood hundreds of times.</span><span id="en6890"> A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6891"> "Good night, citizen," said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him inquisitively.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6892"> "Good night, citizen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6893"> "How goes the Republic?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6894"> "You mean the Guillotine.</span><span id="en6895"> Not ill.</span><span id="en6896"> Sixty-three to-day.</span><span id="en6897"> We shall mount to a hundred soon.</span><span id="en6898"> Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted.</span><span id="en6899"> Ha, ha, ha!</span><span id="en6900"> He is so droll, that Samson.</span><span id="en6901"> Such a Barber!"</span></p>

<p><span id="en6902"> "Shave?</span><span id="en6903"> Always.</span><span id="en6904"> Every day.</span><span id="en6905"> What a barber!</span><span id="en6906"> You have seen him at work?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6907"> "Never."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6908"> "Go and see him when he has a good batch.</span><span id="en6909"> Figure this to yourself, citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes!</span><span id="en6910"> Less than two pipes.</span><span id="en6911"> Word of honour!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6912"> As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6913"> "But you are not English," said the wood-sawyer, "though you wear English dress?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6914"> "Yes," said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6915"> "You speak like a Frenchman."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6916"> "I am an old student here."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6917"> "Aha, a perfect Frenchman!</span><span id="en6918"> Good night, Englishman."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6919"> "Good night, citizen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6920"> "But go and see that droll dog," the little man persisted, calling after him.</span><span id="en6921"> "And take a pipe with you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6922"> Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper.</span><span id="en6923"> Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well, several dark and dirty streets—much dirtier than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terror—he stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with his own hands.</span><span id="en6924"> A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6925"> Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him.</span><span id="en6926"> "Whew!"</span><span id="en6927"> the chemist whistled softly, as he read it.</span><span id="en6928"> "Hi!</span><span id="en6929"> hi!</span><span id="en6930"> hi!"</span></p>

<p><span id="en6931"> "For you, citizen?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6932"> "For me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6933"> "You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen?</span><span id="en6934"> You know the consequences of mixing them?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6935"> "Perfectly."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6936"> Certain small packets were made and given to him.</span><span id="en6937"> He put them, one by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them, and deliberately left the shop.</span><span id="en6938"> "There is nothing more to do," said he, glancing upward at the moon, "until to-morrow.</span><span id="en6939"> I can't sleep."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6940"> It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance.</span><span id="en6941"> It was the settled manner of a tired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into his road and saw its end.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6942"> Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave.</span><span id="en6943"> His mother had died, years before.</span><span id="en6944"> These solemn words, which had been read at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him.</span><span id="en6945"> "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6946"> In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death, and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons, and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep, might have been easily found.</span><span id="en6947"> He did not seek it, but repeated them and went on.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6948"> With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6949"> Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged.</span><span id="en6950"> But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home.</span><span id="en6951"> At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud.</span><span id="en6952"> He carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6953"> "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6954"> Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air.</span><span id="en6955"> Perfectly calm and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he heard them always.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6956"> The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky.</span><span id="en6957"> Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death's dominion.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6958"> But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.</span><span id="en6959"> And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river sparkled under it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6960"> The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness.</span><span id="en6961"> He walked by the stream, far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank.</span><span id="en6962"> When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.</span><span id="en6963"> —"Like me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6964"> A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then glided into his view, floated by him, and died away.</span><span id="en6965"> As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, "I am the resurrection and the life."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6966"> Mr.</span><span id="en6967"> Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone.</span><span id="en6968"> Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6969"> The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep—whom many fell away from in dread—pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.</span><span id="en6970"> Mr.</span><span id="en6971"> Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there.</span><span id="en6972"> She was there, sitting beside her father.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6973"> When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart.</span><span id="en6974"> If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6975"> Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing.</span><span id="en6976"> There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6977"> Every eye was turned to the jury.</span><span id="en6978"> The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after.</span><span id="en6979"> Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators.</span><span id="en6980"> A life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.</span><span id="en6981"> Antoine.</span><span id="en6982"> The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6983"> Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.</span><span id="en6984"> No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day.</span><span id="en6985"> A fell, uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there.</span><span id="en6986"> Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6987"> Charles Evremonde, called Darnay.</span><span id="en6988"> Released yesterday.</span><span id="en6989"> Reaccused and retaken yesterday.</span><span id="en6990"> Indictment delivered to him last night.</span><span id="en6991"> Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people.</span><span id="en6992"> Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6993"> To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.</span></p>
<p><span id="en6994"> The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?</span></p>
<p><span id="en6995"> "Openly, President."</span></p>
<p><span id="en6996"> "By whom?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en6997"> "Three voices.</span><span id="en6998"> Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St.</span><span id="en6999"> Antoine."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7000"> "Good."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7001"> "Therese Defarge, his wife."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7002"> "Good."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7003"> "Alexandre Manette, physician."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7004"> A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7005"> "President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud.</span><span id="en7006"> You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter.</span><span id="en7007"> My daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life.</span><span id="en7008"> Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7009"> "Citizen Manette, be tranquil.</span><span id="en7010"> To fail in submission to the authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law.</span><span id="en7011"> As to what is dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7012"> Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke.</span><span id="en7013"> The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7014"> "If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her.</span><span id="en7015"> Listen to what is to follow.</span><span id="en7016"> In the meanwhile, be silent!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7017"> Frantic acclamations were again raised.</span><span id="en7018"> Doctor Manette sat down, with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew closer to him.</span><span id="en7019"> The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the usual hand to his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7020"> Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.</span><span id="en7021"> This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7022"> "You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7023"> "I believe so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7024"> Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: "You were one of the best patriots there.</span><span id="en7025"> Why not say so?</span><span id="en7026"> You were a cannonier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell.</span><span id="en7027"> Patriots, I speak the truth!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7028"> It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings.</span><span id="en7029"> The President rang his bell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, "I defy that bell!"</span><span id="en7030"> wherein she was likewise much commended.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7031"> "Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille, citizen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7032"> "I knew," said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him; "I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower.</span><span id="en7033"> I knew it from himself.</span><span id="en7034"> He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower, when he made shoes under my care.</span><span id="en7035"> As I serve my gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell.</span><span id="en7036"> It falls.</span><span id="en7037"> I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a gaoler.</span><span id="en7038"> I examine it, very closely.</span><span id="en7039"> In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper.</span><span id="en7040"> This is that written paper.</span><span id="en7041"> I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en7042"> This is the writing of Doctor Manette.</span><span id="en7043"> I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7044"> "Let it be read."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7045"> In a dead silence and stillness—the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them—the paper was read, as follows.</span></p>

<p><span id="en7046"> "I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767.</span><span id="en7047"> I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty.</span><span id="en7048"> I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it.</span><span id="en7049"> Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7050"> "These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity.</span><span id="en7051"> Hope has quite departed from my breast.</span><span id="en7052"> I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind—that my memory is exact and circumstantial—and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7053"> "One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast.</span><span id="en7054"> As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7055"> "The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name.</span><span id="en7056"> I answered.</span><span id="en7057"> The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7058"> "I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves.</span><span id="en7059"> As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7060"> "'You are Doctor Manette?</span><span id="en7061"> ' said one.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7062"> "I am."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7063"> "'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7064"> "'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7065"> "'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you.</span><span id="en7066"> Will you please to enter the carriage?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7067"> "The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.</span><span id="en7068"> They were armed.</span><span id="en7069"> I was not.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7070"> "'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7071"> "The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second.</span><span id="en7072"> 'Doctor, your clients are people of condition.</span><span id="en7073"> As to the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it.</span><span id="en7074"> Enough.</span><span id="en7075"> Will you please to enter the carriage?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7076"> "I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence.</span><span id="en7077"> They both entered after me—the last springing in, after putting up the steps.</span><span id="en7078"> The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7079"> "I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred.</span><span id="en7080"> I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same.</span><span id="en7081"> I describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task.</span><span id="en7082"> Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en7083"> "The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emerged upon the country road.</span><span id="en7084"> At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier—I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed it—it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house.</span><span id="en7085"> It was not opened immediately, in answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7086"> "There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs.</span><span id="en7087"> But, the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7088"> "From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber.</span><span id="en7089"> I was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain, lying on a bed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7090"> "The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much past twenty.</span><span id="en7091"> Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs.</span><span id="en7092"> I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman's dress.</span><span id="en7093"> On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7094"> "I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was in danger of suffocation.</span><span id="en7095"> My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the corner caught my sight.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7096"> "I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down, and looked into her face.</span><span id="en7097"> Her eyes were dilated and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!</span><span id="en7098"> ' and then counted up to twelve, and said, 'Hush!</span><span id="en7099"> ' For an instant, and no more, she would pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she would repeat the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!</span><span id="en7100"> ' and would count up to twelve, and say, 'Hush!</span><span id="en7101"> ' There was no variation in the order, or the manner.</span><span id="en7102"> There was no cessation, but the regular moment's pause, in the utterance of these sounds.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7103"> "'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7104"> "To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority.</span><span id="en7105"> It was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7106"> "'She has a husband, a father, and a brother?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7107"> "'A brother.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7108"> "'I do not address her brother?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7109"> "He answered with great contempt, 'No.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7110"> "'She has some recent association with the number twelve?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7111"> "The younger brother impatiently rejoined, 'With twelve o'clock?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7112"> "'See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, 'how useless I am, as you have brought me!</span><span id="en7113"> If I had known what I was coming to see, I could have come provided.</span><span id="en7114"> As it is, time must be lost.</span><span id="en7115"> There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7116"> "The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, 'There is a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on the table.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en7117"> "I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips.</span><span id="en7118"> If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7119"> "'Do you doubt them?</span><span id="en7120"> ' asked the younger brother.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7121"> "'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7122"> "I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts, the dose that I desired to give.</span><span id="en7123"> As I intended to repeat it after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of the bed.</span><span id="en7124"> There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into a corner.</span><span id="en7125"> The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished—evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used.</span><span id="en7126"> Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks.</span><span id="en7127"> They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!</span><span id="en7128"> ' the counting up to twelve, and 'Hush!</span><span id="en7129"> ' The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful.</span><span id="en7130"> The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure.</span><span id="en7131"> It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.</span></p>

<p><span id="en7132"> "'There is another patient.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7133"> "I was startled, and asked, 'Is it a pressing case?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7134"> "'You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en7135"> "The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft over a stable.</span><span id="en7136"> There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beams across.</span><span id="en7137"> Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand.</span><span id="en7138"> I had to pass through that part, to get at the other.</span><span id="en7139"> My memory is circumstantial and unshaken.</span><span id="en7140"> I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7141"> "On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a handsome peasant boy—a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.</span><span id="en7142"> He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward.</span><span id="en7143"> I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7144"> "'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I.</span><span id="en7145"> 'Let me examine it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7146"> "'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7147"> "It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.</span><span id="en7148"> The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay.</span><span id="en7149"> He was then dying fast.</span><span id="en7150"> As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7151"> "'How has this been done, monsieur?</span><span id="en7152"> ' said I.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7153"> "'A crazed young common dog!</span><span id="en7154"> A serf!</span><span id="en7155"> Forced my brother to draw upon him, and has fallen by my brother's sword—like a gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7156"> "There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer.</span><span id="en7157"> The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind.</span><span id="en7158"> He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy, or about his fate.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7159"> "The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now slowly moved to me.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7160"> "'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are proud too, sometimes.</span><span id="en7161"> They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes.</span><span id="en7162"> She—have you seen her, Doctor?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7163"> "The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance.</span><span id="en7164"> He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7165"> "I said, 'I have seen her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7166"> "'She is my sister, Doctor.</span><span id="en7167"> They have had their shameful rights, these Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we have had good girls among us.</span><span id="en7168"> I know it, and have heard my father say so.</span><span id="en7169"> She was a good girl.</span><span id="en7170"> She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a tenant of his.</span><span id="en7171"> We were all tenants of his—that man's who stands there.</span><span id="en7172"> The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7173"> "It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7174"> "'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs are by those superior Beings—taxed by him without mercy, obliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his people should not see it and take it from us—I say, we were so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out!</span></p>
<p><span id="en7175"> "I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like a fire.</span><span id="en7176"> I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7177"> "'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married.</span><span id="en7178"> He was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage—our dog-hut, as that man would call it.</span><span id="en7179"> She had not been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him—for what are husbands among us!</span><span id="en7180"> He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine.</span><span id="en7181"> What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her willing?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7182"> "The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true.</span><span id="en7183"> The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7184"> "'You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us.</span><span id="en7185"> They so harnessed him and drove him.</span><span id="en7186"> You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed.</span><span id="en7187"> They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day.</span><span id="en7188"> But he was not persuaded.</span><span id="en7189"> No!</span><span id="en7190"> Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed—if he could find food—he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the bell, and died on her bosom.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7191"> "Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong.</span><span id="en7192"> He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his wound.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7193"> "'Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his brother—and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if it is now—his brother took her away—for his pleasure and diversion, for a little while.</span><span id="en7194"> I saw her pass me on the road.</span><span id="en7195"> When I took the tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that filled it.</span><span id="en7196"> I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be his vassal.</span><span id="en7197"> Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in—a common dog, but sword in hand.</span><span id="en7198"> —Where is the loft window?</span><span id="en7199"> It was somewhere here?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7200"> "The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around him.</span><span id="en7201"> I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7202"> "'She heard me, and ran in.</span><span id="en7203"> I told her not to come near us till he was dead.</span><span id="en7204"> He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip.</span><span id="en7205"> But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to make him draw.</span><span id="en7206"> Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself—thrust at me with all his skill for his life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7207"> "My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of a broken sword, lying among the hay.</span><span id="en7208"> That weapon was a gentleman's.</span><span id="en7209"> In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7210"> "'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up.</span><span id="en7211"> Where is he?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7212"> "'He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he referred to the brother.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7213"> "'He!</span><span id="en7214"> Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me.</span><span id="en7215"> Where is the man who was here?</span><span id="en7216"> Turn my face to him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7217"> "I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee.</span><span id="en7218"> But, invested for the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7219"> "'Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and his right hand raised, 'in the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them.</span><span id="en7220"> I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I do it.</span><span id="en7221"> In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately.</span><span id="en7222"> I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7223"> "Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air.</span><span id="en7224"> He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down dead.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en7225"> "When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity.</span><span id="en7226"> I knew that this might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7227"> "I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced.</span><span id="en7228"> She never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words.</span><span id="en7229"> They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother!</span><span id="en7230"> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.</span><span id="en7231"> Hush!</span></p>
<p><span id="en7232"> "This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her.</span><span id="en7233"> I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter.</span><span id="en7234"> I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7235"> "It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm.</span><span id="en7236"> I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn.</span><span id="en7237"> It was then that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7238"> "'Is she dead?</span><span id="en7239"> ' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7240"> "'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7241"> "'What strength there is in these common bodies!</span><span id="en7242"> ' he said, looking down at her with some curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7243"> "'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and despair.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7244"> "He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7245"> "'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited.</span><span id="en7246"> Your reputation is high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest.</span><span id="en7247"> The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7248"> "I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7249"> "'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7250"> "'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.</span><span id="en7251"> ' I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7252"> "Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart.</span><span id="en7253"> There was life, and no more.</span><span id="en7254"> Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en7255"> "I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative.</span><span id="en7256"> There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7257"> "She lingered for a week.</span><span id="en7258"> Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips.</span><span id="en7259"> She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her.</span><span id="en7260"> It was in vain that I asked her for her family name.</span><span id="en7261"> She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7262"> "I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day.</span><span id="en7263"> Until then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there.</span><span id="en7264"> But when it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if—the thought passed through my mind—I were dying too.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7265"> "I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that peasant a boy.</span><span id="en7266"> The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family, and was ridiculous.</span><span id="en7267"> As often as I caught the younger brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the boy.</span><span id="en7268"> He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this.</span><span id="en7269"> I also saw that I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7270"> "My patient died, two hours before midnight—at a time, by my watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her.</span><span id="en7271"> I was alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7272"> "The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride away.</span><span id="en7273"> I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7274"> "'At last she is dead?</span><span id="en7275"> ' said the elder, when I went in.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7276"> "'She is dead,' said I.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7277"> "'I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned round.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7278"> "He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking.</span><span id="en7279"> He now gave me a rouleau of gold.</span><span id="en7280"> I took it from his hand, but laid it on the table.</span><span id="en7281"> I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing.</span></p>

<p><span id="en7297"> "I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself.</span><span id="en7298"> It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7299"> "The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life.</span><span id="en7300"> She was in great agitation.</span><span id="en7301"> She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St.</span><span id="en7302"> Evremonde.</span><span id="en7303"> I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7304"> "My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our conversation.</span><span id="en7305"> I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I know not at what times I may be watched.</span><span id="en7306"> She had in part suspected, and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's share in it, and my being resorted to.</span><span id="en7307"> She did not know that the girl was dead.</span><span id="en7308"> Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in secret, a woman's sympathy.</span><span id="en7309"> Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7310"> "She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and her greatest desire was, to help that sister.</span><span id="en7311"> I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing.</span><span id="en7312"> Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode.</span><span id="en7313"> Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en7314"> "These scraps of paper fail me.</span><span id="en7315"> One was taken from me, with a warning, yesterday.</span><span id="en7316"> I must finish my record to-day.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7317"> "She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage.</span><span id="en7318"> How could she be!</span><span id="en7319"> The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her husband too.</span><span id="en7320"> When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7321"> "'For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, 'I would do all I can to make what poor amends I can.</span><span id="en7322"> He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise.</span><span id="en7323"> I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him.</span><span id="en7324"> What I have left to call my own—it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels—I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the sister can be discovered.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7325"> "She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, 'It is for thine own dear sake.</span><span id="en7326"> Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?</span><span id="en7327"> ' The child answered her bravely, 'Yes!</span><span id="en7328"> ' I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and went away caressing him.</span><span id="en7329"> I never saw her more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7330"> "As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew it, I added no mention of it to my letter.</span><span id="en7331"> I sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7332"> "That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs.</span><span id="en7333"> When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife—O my wife, beloved of my heart!</span><span id="en7334"> My fair young English wife!</span><span id="en7335"> —we saw the man, who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7336"> "An urgent case in the Rue St.</span><span id="en7337"> Honore, he said.</span><span id="en7338"> It would not detain me, he had a coach in waiting.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7339"> "It brought me here, it brought me to my grave.</span><span id="en7340"> When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned.</span><span id="en7341"> The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture.</span><span id="en7342"> The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.</span><span id="en7343"> Not a word was spoken.</span><span id="en7344"> I was brought here, I was brought to my living grave.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7345"> "If it had pleased God to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife—so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead—I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them.</span><span id="en7346"> But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies.</span><span id="en7347"> And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for.</span><span id="en7348"> I denounce them to Heaven and to earth."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7349"> A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done.</span><span id="en7350"> A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood.</span><span id="en7351"> The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7352"> Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time.</span><span id="en7353"> Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.</span><span id="en7354"> The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7355"> And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife.</span><span id="en7356"> One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people's altar.</span><span id="en7357"> Therefore when the President said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of human sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7358"> "Much influence around him, has that Doctor?"</span><span id="en7359"> murmured Madame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance.</span><span id="en7360"> "Save him now, my Doctor, save him!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7361"> At every juryman's vote, there was a roar.</span><span id="en7362"> Another and another.</span><span id="en7363"> Roar and roar.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7364"> Unanimously voted.</span><span id="en7365"> At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People.</span><span id="en7366"> Back to the Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-13_htm_html_pgepubid00045">XI. Dusk</h2>
<p><span id="en7367"> The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken.</span><span id="en7368"> But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7369"> The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, the Tribunal adjourned.</span><span id="en7370"> The quick noise and movement of the court's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7371"> "If I might touch him!</span><span id="en7372"> If I might embrace him once!</span><span id="en7373"> O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7374"> There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him last night, and Barsad.</span><span id="en7375"> The people had all poured out to the show in the streets.</span><span id="en7376"> Barsad proposed to the rest, "Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment."</span><span id="en7377"> It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7378"> "Farewell, dear darling of my soul.</span><span id="en7379"> My parting blessing on my love.</span><span id="en7380"> We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7381"> They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7382"> "I can bear it, dear Charles.</span><span id="en7383"> I am supported from above: don't suffer for me.</span><span id="en7384"> A parting blessing for our child."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7385"> "I send it to her by you.</span><span id="en7386"> I kiss her by you.</span><span id="en7387"> I say farewell to her by you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7388"> "My husband.</span><span id="en7389"> No!</span><span id="en7390"> A moment!"</span><span id="en7391"> He was tearing himself apart from her.</span><span id="en7392"> "We shall not be separated long.</span><span id="en7393"> I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me."</span></p>

<p><span id="en7394"> "No, no!</span><span id="en7395"> What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us!</span><span id="en7396"> We know now, what a struggle you made of old.</span><span id="en7397"> We know, now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it.</span><span id="en7398"> We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake.</span><span id="en7399"> We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty.</span><span id="en7400"> Heaven be with you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7401"> Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7402"> "It could not be otherwise," said the prisoner.</span><span id="en7403"> "All things have worked together as they have fallen out.</span><span id="en7404"> It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence near you.</span><span id="en7405"> Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning.</span><span id="en7406"> Be comforted, and forgive me.</span><span id="en7407"> Heaven bless you!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7408"> As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile.</span><span id="en7409"> As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7410"> Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved, Sydney Carton came and took her up.</span><span id="en7411"> Only her father and Mr.</span><span id="en7412"> Lorry were with her.</span><span id="en7413"> His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.</span><span id="en7414"> Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity—that had a flush of pride in it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7415"> "Shall I take her to a coach?</span><span id="en7416"> I shall never feel her weight."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7417"> He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a coach.</span><span id="en7418"> Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat beside the driver.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7419"> When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up the staircase to their rooms.</span><span id="en7420"> There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7421"> "Don't recall her to herself," he said, softly, to the latter, "she is better so.</span><span id="en7422"> Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7423"> "Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!"</span><span id="en7424"> cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief.</span><span id="en7425"> "Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa!</span><span id="en7426"> O, look at her, dear Carton!</span><span id="en7427"> Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7428"> He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face.</span><span id="en7429"> He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7430"> "Before I go," he said, and paused—"I may kiss her?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7431"> It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words.</span><span id="en7432"> The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, "A life you love."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7433"> When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7434"> "You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried.</span><span id="en7435"> These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7436"> "Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me.</span><span id="en7437"> I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did."</span><span id="en7438"> He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7439"> "Try them again.</span><span id="en7440"> The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7441"> "I intend to try.</span><span id="en7442"> I will not rest a moment."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7443"> "That's well.</span><span id="en7444"> I have known such energy as yours do great things before now—though never," he added, with a smile and a sigh together, "such great things as this.</span><span id="en7445"> But try!</span><span id="en7446"> Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort.</span><span id="en7447"> It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7448"> "I will go," said Doctor Manette, "to the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name.</span><span id="en7449"> I will write too, and—But stay!</span><span id="en7450"> There is a Celebration in the streets, and no one will be accessible until dark."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7451"> "That's true.</span><span id="en7452"> Well!</span><span id="en7453"> It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark.</span><span id="en7454"> I should like to know how you speed; though, mind!</span><span id="en7455"> I expect nothing!</span><span id="en7456"> When are you likely to have seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7457"> "Immediately after dark, I should hope.</span><span id="en7458"> Within an hour or two from this."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7459"> "It will be dark soon after four.</span><span id="en7460"> Let us stretch the hour or two.</span><span id="en7461"> If I go to Mr.</span><span id="en7462"> Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from our friend or from yourself?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7463"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7464"> "May you prosper!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7465"> Mr.</span><span id="en7466"> Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7467"> "I have no hope," said Mr.</span><span id="en7468"> Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7469"> "Nor have I."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7470"> "If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare him—which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man's to them!</span><span id="en7471"> —I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7472"> "And so do I.</span><span id="en7473"> I heard the fall of the axe in that sound."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7474"> Mr.</span><span id="en7475"> Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7476"> "Don't despond," said Carton, very gently; "don't grieve.</span><span id="en7477"> I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her.</span><span id="en7478"> Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7479"> "Yes, yes, yes," returned Mr.</span><span id="en7480"> Lorry, drying his eyes, "you are right.</span><span id="en7481"> But he will perish; there is no real hope."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7482"> "Yes.</span><span id="en7483"> He will perish: there is no real hope," echoed Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7484"> And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.</span></p>


<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-13_htm_html_pgepubid00046">XII. Darkness</h2>
<p><span id="en7485"> Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go.</span><span id="en7486"> "At Tellson's banking-house at nine," he said, with a musing face.</span><span id="en7487"> "Shall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself?</span><span id="en7488"> I think so.</span><span id="en7489"> It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation.</span><span id="en7490"> But care, care, care!</span><span id="en7491"> Let me think it out!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7492"> Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences.</span><span id="en7493"> His first impression was confirmed.</span><span id="en7494"> "It is best," he said, finally resolved, "that these people should know there is such a man as I here."</span><span id="en7495"> And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7496"> Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb.</span><span id="en7497"> It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question.</span><span id="en7498"> Having ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner.</span><span id="en7499"> For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink.</span><span id="en7500"> Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr.</span><span id="en7501"> Lorry's hearth like a man who had done with it.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7502"> It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out into the streets again.</span><span id="en7503"> As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair.</span><span id="en7504"> This done, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7505"> There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the restless fingers and the croaking voice.</span><span id="en7506"> This man, whom he had seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges, man and wife.</span><span id="en7507"> The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7508"> As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7509"> He repeated what he had already said.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7510"> "English?"</span><span id="en7511"> asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7512"> After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign accent.</span><span id="en7513"> "Yes, madame, yes.</span><span id="en7514"> I am English!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7515"> Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he heard her say, "I swear to you, like Evremonde!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7516"> Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7517"> "How?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7518"> "Good evening."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7519"> "Oh!</span><span id="en7520"> Good evening, citizen," filling his glass.</span><span id="en7521"> "Ah!</span><span id="en7522"> and good wine.</span><span id="en7523"> I drink to the Republic."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7524"> Defarge went back to the counter, and said, "Certainly, a little like."</span><span id="en7525"> Madame sternly retorted, "I tell you a good deal like."</span><span id="en7526"> Jacques Three pacifically remarked, "He is so much in your mind, see you, madame."</span><span id="en7527"> The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, "Yes, my faith!</span><span id="en7528"> And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7529"> Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face.</span><span id="en7530"> They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together, speaking low.</span><span id="en7531"> After a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed their conversation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7532"> "It is true what madame says," observed Jacques Three.</span><span id="en7533"> "Why stop?</span><span id="en7534"> There is great force in that.</span><span id="en7535"> Why stop?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7536"> "Well, well," reasoned Defarge, "but one must stop somewhere.</span><span id="en7537"> After all, the question is still where?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7538"> "At extermination," said madame.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7539"> "Magnificent!"</span><span id="en7540"> croaked Jacques Three.</span><span id="en7541"> The Vengeance, also, highly approved.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7542"> "Extermination is good doctrine, my wife," said Defarge, rather troubled; "in general, I say nothing against it.</span><span id="en7543"> But this Doctor has suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when the paper was read."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7544"> "I have observed his face!"</span><span id="en7545"> repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.</span><span id="en7546"> "Yes.</span><span id="en7547"> I have observed his face.</span><span id="en7548"> I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic.</span><span id="en7549"> Let him take care of his face!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7550"> "And you have observed, my wife," said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner, "the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7551"> "I have observed his daughter," repeated madame; "yes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one.</span><span id="en7552"> I have observed her to-day, and I have observed her other days.</span><span id="en7553"> I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her in the street by the prison.</span><span id="en7554"> Let me but lift my finger—!"</span><span id="en7555"> She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7556"> "The citizeness is superb!"</span><span id="en7557"> croaked the Juryman.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7558"> "She is an Angel!"</span><span id="en7559"> said The Vengeance, and embraced her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7560"> "As to thee," pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, "if it depended on thee—which, happily, it does not—thou wouldst rescue this man even now."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7561"> "No!"</span><span id="en7562"> protested Defarge.</span><span id="en7563"> "Not if to lift this glass would do it!</span><span id="en7564"> But I would leave the matter there.</span><span id="en7565"> I say, stop there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7566"> "See you then, Jacques," said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; "and see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both!</span><span id="en7567"> Listen!</span><span id="en7568"> For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to destruction and extermination.</span><span id="en7569"> Ask my husband, is that so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7570"> "It is so," assented Defarge, without being asked.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7571"> "In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light of this lamp.</span><span id="en7572"> Ask him, is that so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7573"> "It is so," assented Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7574"> "That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate.</span><span id="en7575"> Ask him, is that so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7576"> "It is so," assented Defarge again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7577"> "I communicate to him that secret.</span><span id="en7578"> I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, 'Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my family.</span><span id="en7579"> Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me!</span><span id="en7580"> ' Ask him, is that so."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7581"> "It is so," assented Defarge once more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7582"> "Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop," returned madame; "but don't tell me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7583"> Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath—the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing her—and both highly commended it.</span><span id="en7584"> Defarge, a weak minority, interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply.</span><span id="en7585"> "Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7586"> Customers entered, and the group was broken up.</span><span id="en7587"> The English customer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace.</span><span id="en7588"> Madame Defarge took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.</span><span id="en7589"> The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7590"> But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall.</span><span id="en7591"> At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present himself in Mr.</span><span id="en7592"> Lorry's room again, where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety.</span><span id="en7593"> He said he had been with Lucie until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment.</span><span id="en7594"> Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the banking-house towards four o'clock.</span><span id="en7595"> She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight.</span><span id="en7596"> He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7597"> Mr.</span><span id="en7598"> Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.</span><span id="en7599"> In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7600"> He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back.</span><span id="en7601"> Mr.</span><span id="en7602"> Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and brought none.</span><span id="en7603"> Where could he be?</span></p>
<p><span id="en7604"> They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs.</span><span id="en7605"> The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was lost.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7606"> Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known.</span><span id="en7607"> As he stood staring at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7608"> "I cannot find it," said he, "and I must have it.</span><span id="en7609"> Where is it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7610"> His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7611"> "Where is my bench?</span><span id="en7612"> I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I can't find it.</span><span id="en7613"> What have they done with my work?</span><span id="en7614"> Time presses: I must finish those shoes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7615"> They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7616"> "Come, come!"</span><span id="en7617"> said he, in a whimpering miserable way; "let me get to work.</span><span id="en7618"> Give me my work."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7619"> Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the ground, like a distracted child.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7620"> "Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch," he implored them, with a dreadful cry; "but give me my work!</span><span id="en7621"> What is to become of us, if those shoes are not done to-night?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7622"> Lost, utterly lost!</span></p>
<p><span id="en7623"> It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him, that—as if by agreement—they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should have his work presently.</span><span id="en7624"> He sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears.</span><span id="en7625"> As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr.</span><span id="en7626"> Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7627"> Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions.</span><span id="en7628"> His lonely daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly.</span><span id="en7629"> Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7630"> "The last chance is gone: it was not much.</span><span id="en7631"> Yes; he had better be taken to her.</span><span id="en7632"> But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me?</span><span id="en7633"> Don't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason—a good one."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7634"> "I do not doubt it," answered Mr.</span><span id="en7635"> Lorry.</span><span id="en7636"> "Say on."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7637"> The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning.</span><span id="en7638"> They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7639"> Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his feet.</span><span id="en7640"> As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor.</span><span id="en7641"> Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it.</span><span id="en7642"> "We should look at this!"</span><span id="en7643"> he said.</span><span id="en7644"> Mr.</span><span id="en7645"> Lorry nodded his consent.</span><span id="en7646"> He opened it, and exclaimed, "Thank God!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7647"> "What is it?"</span><span id="en7648"> asked Mr.</span><span id="en7649"> Lorry, eagerly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7650"> "A moment!</span><span id="en7651"> Let me speak of it in its place.</span><span id="en7652"> First," he put his hand in his coat, and took another paper from it, "that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city.</span><span id="en7653"> Look at it.</span><span id="en7654"> You see—Sydney Carton, an Englishman?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7655"> Mr.</span><span id="en7656"> Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7657"> "Keep it for me until to-morrow.</span><span id="en7658"> I shall see him to-morrow, you remember, and I had better not take it into the prison."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7659"> "Why not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7660"> "I don't know; I prefer not to do so.</span><span id="en7661"> Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him.</span><span id="en7662"> It is a similar certificate, enabling him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier!</span><span id="en7663"> You see?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7664"> "Yes!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7665"> "Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday.</span><span id="en7666"> When is it dated?</span><span id="en7667"> But no matter; don't stay to look; put it up carefully with mine and your own.</span><span id="en7668"> Now, observe!</span><span id="en7669"> I never doubted until within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper.</span><span id="en7670"> It is good, until recalled.</span><span id="en7671"> But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to think, will be."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7672"> "They are not in danger?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7673"> "They are in great danger.</span><span id="en7674"> They are in danger of denunciation by Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en7675"> I know it from her own lips.</span><span id="en7676"> I have overheard words of that woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours.</span><span id="en7677"> I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy.</span><span id="en7678"> He confirms me.</span><span id="en7679"> He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her"—he never mentioned Lucie's name—"making signs and signals to prisoners.</span><span id="en7680"> It is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will involve her life—and perhaps her child's—and perhaps her father's—for both have been seen with her at that place.</span><span id="en7681"> Don't look so horrified.</span><span id="en7682"> You will save them all."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7683"> "Heaven grant I may, Carton!</span><span id="en7684"> But how?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7685"> "I am going to tell you how.</span><span id="en7686"> It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man.</span><span id="en7687"> This new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably a week afterwards.</span><span id="en7688"> You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine.</span><span id="en7689"> She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure.</span><span id="en7690"> You follow me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7691"> "So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for the moment I lose sight," touching the back of the Doctor's chair, "even of this distress."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7692"> "You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made.</span><span id="en7693"> Your preparations have been completed for some days, to return to England.</span><span id="en7694"> Early to-morrow have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the afternoon."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7695"> "It shall be done!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7696"> His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr.</span><span id="en7697"> Lorry caught the flame, and was as quick as youth.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7698"> "You are a noble heart.</span><span id="en7699"> Did I say we could depend upon no better man?</span><span id="en7700"> Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father.</span><span id="en7701"> Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband's cheerfully."</span><span id="en7702"> He faltered for an instant; then went on as before.</span><span id="en7703"> "For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour.</span><span id="en7704"> Tell her that it was her husband's last arrangement.</span><span id="en7705"> Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope.</span><span id="en7706"> You think that her father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7707"> "I am sure of it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7708"> "I thought so.</span><span id="en7709"> Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.</span><span id="en7710"> The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7711"> "I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7712"> "You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will reserve my place.</span><span id="en7713"> Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and then for England!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7714"> "Why, then," said Mr.</span><span id="en7715"> Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand, "it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7716"> "By the help of Heaven you shall!</span><span id="en7717"> Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7718"> "Nothing, Carton."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7719"> "Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it—for any reason—and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7720"> "I will remember them.</span><span id="en7721"> I hope to do my part faithfully."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7722"> "And I hope to do mine.</span><span id="en7723"> Now, good bye!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7724"> Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even put the old man's hand to his lips, he did not part from him then.</span><span id="en7725"> He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have.</span><span id="en7726"> He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart—so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it—outwatched the awful night.</span><span id="en7727"> He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her room.</span><span id="en7728"> Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-14_htm_html_pgepubid00047">XIII. Fifty-two</h2>
<p><span id="en7729"> In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited their fate.</span><span id="en7730"> They were in number as the weeks of the year.</span><span id="en7731"> Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea.</span><span id="en7732"> Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7733"> Two score and twelve were told off.</span><span id="en7734"> From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her.</span><span id="en7735"> Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7736"> Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal.</span><span id="en7737"> In every line of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation.</span><span id="en7738"> He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail him nothing.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7739"> Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear.</span><span id="en7740"> His hold on life was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was closed again.</span><span id="en7741"> There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation.</span><span id="en7742"> If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7743"> But, all this was at first.</span><span id="en7744"> Before long, the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him.</span><span id="en7745"> Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude.</span><span id="en7746"> So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7747"> Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way.</span><span id="en7748"> Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7749"> He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read.</span><span id="en7750"> He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition—fully intelligible now—that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage.</span><span id="en7751"> He entreated her, for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden.</span><span id="en7752"> If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world.</span><span id="en7753"> He besought her—though he added that he knew it was needless—to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes.</span><span id="en7754"> Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7755"> To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care.</span><span id="en7756"> And he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7757"> To Mr.</span><span id="en7758"> Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.</span><span id="en7759"> That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment, all was done.</span><span id="en7760"> He never thought of Carton.</span><span id="en7761"> His mind was so full of the others, that he never once thought of him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7762"> He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out.</span><span id="en7763"> When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7764"> But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining forms.</span><span id="en7765"> Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away.</span><span id="en7766"> A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there was no difference in him.</span><span id="en7767"> Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it flashed upon his mind, "this is the day of my death!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7768"> Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall.</span><span id="en7769"> And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking thoughts, which was very difficult to master.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7770"> He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life.</span><span id="en7771"> How high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless times.</span><span id="en7772"> Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no fear.</span><span id="en7773"> Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7774"> The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again.</span><span id="en7775"> Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away.</span><span id="en7776"> After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him, he had got the better of it.</span><span id="en7777"> He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself.</span><span id="en7778"> The worst of the strife was over.</span><span id="en7779"> He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself and for them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7780"> Twelve gone for ever.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7781"> He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets.</span><span id="en7782"> Therefore, he resolved to keep Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7783"> Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise.</span><span id="en7784"> The hour had measured like most other hours.</span><span id="en7785"> Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession, he thought, "There is but another now," and turned to walk again.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7786"> Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door.</span><span id="en7787"> He stopped.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7788"> The key was put in the lock, and turned.</span><span id="en7789"> Before the door was opened, or as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: "He has never seen me here; I have kept out of his way.</span><span id="en7790"> Go you in alone; I wait near.</span><span id="en7791"> Lose no time!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7792"> The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7793"> There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining.</span><span id="en7794"> But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner's hand, and it was his real grasp.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7795"> "Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?"</span><span id="en7796"> he said.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7797"> "I could not believe it to be you.</span><span id="en7798"> I can scarcely believe it now.</span><span id="en7799"> You are not"—the apprehension came suddenly into his mind—"a prisoner?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7800"> "No.</span><span id="en7801"> I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here, and in virtue of it I stand before you.</span><span id="en7802"> I come from her—your wife, dear Darnay."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7803"> The prisoner wrung his hand.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7804"> "I bring you a request from her."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7805"> "What is it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7806"> "A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well remember."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7807"> The prisoner turned his face partly aside.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7808"> "You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have no time to tell you.</span><span id="en7809"> You must comply with it—take off those boots you wear, and draw on these of mine."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7810"> There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.</span><span id="en7811"> Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7812"> "Draw on these boots of mine.</span><span id="en7813"> Put your hands to them; put your will to them.</span><span id="en7814"> Quick!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7815"> "Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done.</span><span id="en7816"> You will only die with me.</span><span id="en7817"> It is madness."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7818"> "It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I?</span><span id="en7819"> When I ask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here.</span><span id="en7820"> Change that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine.</span><span id="en7821"> While you do it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like this of mine!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7822"> With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him.</span><span id="en7823"> The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7824"> "Carton!</span><span id="en7825"> Dear Carton!</span><span id="en7826"> It is madness.</span><span id="en7827"> It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed.</span><span id="en7828"> I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7829"> "Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door?</span><span id="en7830"> When I ask that, refuse.</span><span id="en7831"> There are pen and ink and paper on this table.</span><span id="en7832"> Is your hand steady enough to write?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7833"> "It was when you came in."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7834"> "Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate.</span><span id="en7835"> Quick, friend, quick!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7836"> Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.</span><span id="en7837"> Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7838"> "Write exactly as I speak."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7839"> "To whom do I address it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7840"> "To no one."</span><span id="en7841"> Carton still had his hand in his breast.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7842"> "Do I date it?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7843"> "No."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7844"> The prisoner looked up, at each question.</span><span id="en7845"> Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7846"> "'If you remember,'" said Carton, dictating, "'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.</span><span id="en7847"> You do remember them, I know.</span><span id="en7848"> It is not in your nature to forget them.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7849"> He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7850"> "Have you written 'forget them'?"</span><span id="en7851"> Carton asked.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7852"> "I have.</span><span id="en7853"> Is that a weapon in your hand?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7854"> "No; I am not armed."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7855"> "What is it in your hand?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7856"> "You shall know directly.</span><span id="en7857"> Write on; there are but a few words more."</span><span id="en7858"> He dictated again.</span><span id="en7859"> "'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them.</span><span id="en7860"> That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.</span><span id="en7861"> '" As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7862"> The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7863"> "What vapour is that?"</span><span id="en7864"> he asked.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7865"> "Vapour?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7866"> "Something that crossed me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7867"> "I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here.</span><span id="en7868"> Take up the pen and finish.</span><span id="en7869"> Hurry, hurry!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7870"> As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention.</span><span id="en7871"> As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton—his hand again in his breast—looked steadily at him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7872"> "Hurry, hurry!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7873"> The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7874"> "'If it had been otherwise;'" Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; "'I never should have used the longer opportunity.</span><span id="en7875"> If it had been otherwise;'" the hand was at the prisoner's face; "'I should but have had so much the more to answer for.</span><span id="en7876"> If it had been otherwise—'" Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7877"> Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more.</span><span id="en7878"> The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.</span><span id="en7879"> For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7880"> Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn.</span><span id="en7881"> Then, he softly called, "Enter there!</span><span id="en7882"> Come in!"</span><span id="en7883"> and the Spy presented himself.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7884"> "You see?"</span><span id="en7885"> said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: "is your hazard very great?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7886"> "Mr.</span><span id="en7887"> Carton," the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, "my hazard is not that, in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7888"> "Don't fear me.</span><span id="en7889"> I will be true to the death."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7890"> "You must be, Mr.</span><span id="en7891"> Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right.</span><span id="en7892"> Being made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7893"> "Have no fear!</span><span id="en7894"> I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the rest will soon be far from here, please God!</span><span id="en7895"> Now, get assistance and take me to the coach."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7896"> "You?"</span><span id="en7897"> said the Spy nervously.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7898"> "Him, man, with whom I have exchanged.</span><span id="en7899"> You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7900"> "Of course."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7901"> "I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take me out.</span><span id="en7902"> The parting interview has overpowered me.</span><span id="en7903"> Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often.</span><span id="en7904"> Your life is in your own hands.</span><span id="en7905"> Quick!</span><span id="en7906"> Call assistance!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7907"> "You swear not to betray me?"</span><span id="en7908"> said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a last moment.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7909"> "Man, man!"</span><span id="en7910"> returned Carton, stamping his foot; "have I sworn by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now?</span><span id="en7911"> Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr.</span><span id="en7912"> Lorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7913"> The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his forehead on his hands.</span><span id="en7914"> The Spy returned immediately, with two men.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7915"> "How, then?"</span><span id="en7916"> said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure.</span><span id="en7917"> "So afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte Guillotine?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7918"> "A good patriot," said the other, "could hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7919"> They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7920"> "The time is short, Evremonde," said the Spy, in a warning voice.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7921"> "I know it well," answered Carton.</span><span id="en7922"> "Be careful of my friend, I entreat you, and leave me."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7923"> "Come, then, my children," said Barsad.</span><span id="en7924"> "Lift him, and come away!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7925"> The door closed, and Carton was left alone.</span><span id="en7926"> Straining his powers of listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm.</span><span id="en7927"> There was none.</span><span id="en7928"> Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that seemed unusual.</span><span id="en7929"> Breathing more freely in a little while, he sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7930"> Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then began to be audible.</span><span id="en7931"> Several doors were opened in succession, and finally his own.</span><span id="en7932"> A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying, "Follow me, Evremonde!"</span><span id="en7933"> and he followed into a large dark room, at a distance.</span><span id="en7934"> It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound.</span><span id="en7935"> Some were standing; some seated.</span><span id="en7936"> Some were lamenting, and in restless motion; but, these were few.</span><span id="en7937"> The great majority were silent and still, looking fixedly at the ground.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7938"> As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him, as having a knowledge of him.</span><span id="en7939"> It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on.</span><span id="en7940"> A very few moments after that, a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7941"> "Citizen Evremonde," she said, touching him with her cold hand.</span><span id="en7942"> "I am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7943"> He murmured for answer: "True.</span><span id="en7944"> I forget what you were accused of?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7945"> "Plots.</span><span id="en7946"> Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any.</span><span id="en7947"> Is it likely?</span><span id="en7948"> Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7949"> The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears started from his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7950"> "I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing.</span><span id="en7951"> I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be, Citizen Evremonde.</span><span id="en7952"> Such a poor weak little creature!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7953"> As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7954"> "I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde.</span><span id="en7955"> I hoped it was true?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7956"> "It was.</span><span id="en7957"> But, I was again taken and condemned."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7958"> "If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your hand?</span><span id="en7959"> I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me more courage."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7960"> As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.</span><span id="en7961"> He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young fingers, and touched his lips.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7962"> "Are you dying for him?"</span><span id="en7963"> she whispered.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7964"> "And his wife and child.</span><span id="en7965"> Hush!</span><span id="en7966"> Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en7967"> "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7968"> "Hush!</span><span id="en7969"> Yes, my poor sister; to the last."</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en7970"> The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7971"> "Who goes here?</span><span id="en7972"> Whom have we within?</span><span id="en7973"> Papers!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7974"> The papers are handed out, and read.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7975"> "Alexandre Manette.</span><span id="en7976"> Physician.</span><span id="en7977"> French.</span><span id="en7978"> Which is he?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7979"> This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7980"> "Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind?</span><span id="en7981"> The Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7982"> Greatly too much for him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7983"> "Hah!</span><span id="en7984"> Many suffer with it.</span><span id="en7985"> Lucie.</span><span id="en7986"> His daughter.</span><span id="en7987"> French.</span><span id="en7988"> Which is she?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7989"> This is she.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7990"> "Apparently it must be.</span><span id="en7991"> Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7992"> It is.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7993"> "Hah!</span><span id="en7994"> Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere.</span><span id="en7995"> Lucie, her child.</span><span id="en7996"> English.</span><span id="en7997"> This is she?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en7998"> She and no other.</span></p>
<p><span id="en7999"> "Kiss me, child of Evremonde.</span><span id="en8000"> Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican; something new in thy family; remember it!</span><span id="en8001"> Sydney Carton.</span><span id="en8002"> Advocate.</span><span id="en8003"> English.</span><span id="en8004"> Which is he?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8005"> He lies here, in this corner of the carriage.</span><span id="en8006"> He, too, is pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8007"> "Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8008"> It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air.</span><span id="en8009"> It is represented that he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8010"> "Is that all?</span><span id="en8011"> It is not a great deal, that!</span><span id="en8012"> Many are under the displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window.</span><span id="en8013"> Jarvis Lorry.</span><span id="en8014"> Banker.</span><span id="en8015"> English.</span><span id="en8016"> Which is he?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8017"> "I am he.</span><span id="en8018"> Necessarily, being the last."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8019"> It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions.</span><span id="en8020"> It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door, replying to a group of officials.</span><span id="en8021"> They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8022"> "Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8023"> "One can depart, citizen?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8024"> "One can depart.</span><span id="en8025"> Forward, my postilions!</span><span id="en8026"> A good journey!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8027"> "I salute you, citizens.</span><span id="en8028"> —And the first danger passed!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8029"> These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and looks upward.</span><span id="en8030"> There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8031"> "Are we not going too slowly?</span><span id="en8032"> Can they not be induced to go faster?"</span><span id="en8033"> asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8034"> "It would seem like flight, my darling.</span><span id="en8035"> I must not urge them too much; it would rouse suspicion."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8036"> "Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8037"> "The road is clear, my dearest.</span><span id="en8038"> So far, we are not pursued."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8039"> Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees.</span><span id="en8040"> The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on either side.</span><span id="en8041"> Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and sloughs there.</span><span id="en8042"> The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running—hiding—doing anything but stopping.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8043"> Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes, avenues of leafless trees.</span><span id="en8044"> Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road?</span><span id="en8045"> Is not this the same place twice over?</span><span id="en8046"> Thank Heaven, no.</span><span id="en8047"> A village.</span><span id="en8048"> Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!</span><span id="en8049"> Hush!</span><span id="en8050"> the posting-house.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8051"> Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.</span><span id="en8052"> All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8053"> At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left behind.</span><span id="en8054"> We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and on the low watery grounds.</span><span id="en8055"> Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their haunches.</span><span id="en8056"> We are pursued?</span></p>
<p><span id="en8057"> "Ho!</span><span id="en8058"> Within the carriage there.</span><span id="en8059"> Speak then!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8060"> "What is it?"</span><span id="en8061"> asks Mr.</span><span id="en8062"> Lorry, looking out at window.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8063"> "How many did they say?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8064"> "I do not understand you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8065"> "—At the last post.</span><span id="en8066"> How many to the Guillotine to-day?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8067"> "Fifty-two."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8068"> "I said so!</span><span id="en8069"> A brave number!</span><span id="en8070"> My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having.</span><span id="en8071"> The Guillotine goes handsomely.</span><span id="en8072"> I love it.</span><span id="en8073"> Hi forward.</span><span id="en8074"> Whoop!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8075"> The night comes on dark.</span><span id="en8076"> He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him, by his name, what he has in his hand.</span><span id="en8077"> O pity us, kind Heaven, and help us!</span><span id="en8078"> Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8079"> The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.</span></p>

<p><span id="en8080"> In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury.</span><span id="en8081"> Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads.</span><span id="en8082"> The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8083"> "But our Defarge," said Jacques Three, "is undoubtedly a good Republican?</span><span id="en8084"> Eh?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8085"> "There is no better," the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes, "in France."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8086"> "Peace, little Vengeance," said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, "hear me speak.</span><span id="en8087"> My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence.</span><span id="en8088"> But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8089"> "It is a great pity," croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; "it is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8090"> "See you," said madame, "I care nothing for this Doctor, I.</span><span id="en8091"> He may wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to me.</span><span id="en8092"> But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8093"> "She has a fine head for it," croaked Jacques Three.</span><span id="en8094"> "I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up."</span><span id="en8095"> Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8096"> Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8097"> "The child also," observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, "has golden hair and blue eyes.</span><span id="en8098"> And we seldom have a child there.</span><span id="en8099"> It is a pretty sight!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8100"> "In a word," said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, "I cannot trust my husband in this matter.</span><span id="en8101"> Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8102"> "That must never be," croaked Jacques Three; "no one must escape.</span><span id="en8103"> We have not half enough as it is.</span><span id="en8104"> We ought to have six score a day."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8105"> "In a word," Madame Defarge went on, "my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility.</span><span id="en8106"> I must act for myself, therefore.</span><span id="en8107"> Come hither, little citizen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8108"> The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8109"> "Touching those signals, little citizen," said Madame Defarge, sternly, "that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8110"> "Ay, ay, why not!"</span><span id="en8111"> cried the sawyer.</span><span id="en8112"> "Every day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without.</span><span id="en8113"> I know what I know.</span><span id="en8114"> I have seen with my eyes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8115"> He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8116"> "Clearly plots," said Jacques Three.</span><span id="en8117"> "Transparently!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8118"> "There is no doubt of the Jury?"</span><span id="en8119"> inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8120"> "Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness.</span><span id="en8121"> I answer for my fellow-Jurymen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8122"> "Now, let me see," said Madame Defarge, pondering again.</span><span id="en8123"> "Yet once more!</span><span id="en8124"> Can I spare this Doctor to my husband?</span><span id="en8125"> I have no feeling either way.</span><span id="en8126"> Can I spare him?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8127"> "He would count as one head," observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.</span><span id="en8128"> "We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8129"> "He was signalling with her when I saw her," argued Madame Defarge; "I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here.</span><span id="en8130"> For, I am not a bad witness."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8131"> The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses.</span><span id="en8132"> The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial witness.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8133"> "He must take his chance," said Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en8134"> "No, I cannot spare him!</span><span id="en8135"> You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed.</span><span id="en8136"> —You?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8137"> The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber.</span><span id="en8138"> He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8139"> "I," said madame, "am equally engaged at the same place.</span><span id="en8140"> After it is over—say at eight to-night—come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we will give information against these people at my Section."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8141"> The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness.</span><span id="en8142"> The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.</span></p>

<p><span id="en8143"> "She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death.</span><span id="en8144"> She will be mourning and grieving.</span><span id="en8145"> She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic.</span><span id="en8146"> She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.</span><span id="en8147"> I will go to her."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8148"> "What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!"</span><span id="en8149"> exclaimed Jacques Three, rapturously.</span><span id="en8150"> "Ah, my cherished!"</span><span id="en8151"> cried The Vengeance; and embraced her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8152"> "Take you my knitting," said Madame Defarge, placing it in her lieutenant's hands, "and have it ready for me in my usual seat.</span><span id="en8153"> Keep me my usual chair.</span><span id="en8154"> Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, to-day."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8155"> "I willingly obey the orders of my Chief," said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her cheek.</span><span id="en8156"> "You will not be late?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8157"> "I shall be there before the commencement."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8158"> "And before the tumbrils arrive.</span><span id="en8159"> Be sure you are there, my soul," said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street, "before the tumbrils arrive!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8160"> Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall.</span><span id="en8161"> The Vengeance and the Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8162"> There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets.</span><span id="en8163"> Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances.</span><span id="en8164"> But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress.</span><span id="en8165"> She was absolutely without pity.</span><span id="en8166"> If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8167"> It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them.</span><span id="en8168"> It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live.</span><span id="en8169"> To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself.</span><span id="en8170"> If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8171"> Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe.</span><span id="en8172"> Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap.</span><span id="en8173"> Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol.</span><span id="en8174"> Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger.</span><span id="en8175"> Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8176"> Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr.</span><span id="en8177"> Lorry's attention.</span><span id="en8178"> It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.</span><span id="en8179"> Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.</span><span id="en8180"> Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8181"> Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy.</span><span id="en8182"> She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8183"> "Now what do you think, Mr.</span><span id="en8184"> Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: "what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard?</span><span id="en8185"> Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8186"> "My opinion, miss," returned Mr.</span><span id="en8187"> Cruncher, "is as you're right.</span><span id="en8188"> Likewise wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8189"> "I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures," said Miss Pross, wildly crying, "that I am incapable of forming any plan.</span><span id="en8190"> Are you capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr.</span><span id="en8191"> Cruncher?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8192"> "Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss," returned Mr.</span><span id="en8193"> Cruncher, "I hope so.</span><span id="en8194"> Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mine, I think not.</span><span id="en8195"> Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o' two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8196"> "Oh, for gracious sake!"</span><span id="en8197"> cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, "record them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8198"> "First," said Mr.</span><span id="en8199"> Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, "them poor things well out o' this, never no more will I do it, never no more!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8200"> "I am quite sure, Mr.</span><span id="en8201"> Cruncher," returned Miss Pross, "that you never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8202"> "No, miss," returned Jerry, "it shall not be named to you.</span><span id="en8203"> Second: them poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs.</span><span id="en8204"> Cruncher's flopping, never no more!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8205"> "Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be," said Miss Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, "I have no doubt it is best that Mrs.</span><span id="en8206"> Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.</span><span id="en8207"> —O my poor darlings!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8208"> "I go so far as to say, miss, moreover," proceeded Mr.</span><span id="en8209"> Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit—"and let my words be took down and took to Mrs.</span><span id="en8210"> Cruncher through yourself—that wot my opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs.</span><span id="en8211"> Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8212"> "There, there, there!</span><span id="en8213"> I hope she is, my dear man," cried the distracted Miss Pross, "and I hope she finds it answering her expectations."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8214"> "Forbid it," proceeded Mr.</span><span id="en8215"> Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, "as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now!</span><span id="en8216"> Forbid it as we shouldn't all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here dismal risk!</span><span id="en8217"> Forbid it, miss!</span><span id="en8218"> Wot I say, for-bid it!"</span><span id="en8219"> This was Mr.</span><span id="en8220"> Cruncher's conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8221"> And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8222"> "If we ever get back to our native land," said Miss Pross, "you may rely upon my telling Mrs.</span><span id="en8223"> Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time.</span><span id="en8224"> Now, pray let us think!</span><span id="en8225"> My esteemed Mr.</span><span id="en8226"> Cruncher, let us think!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8227"> Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8228"> "If you were to go before," said Miss Pross, "and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't that be best?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8229"> Mr.</span><span id="en8230"> Cruncher thought it might be best.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8231"> "Where could you wait for me?"</span><span id="en8232"> asked Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8233"> Mr.</span><span id="en8234"> Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar.</span><span id="en8235"> Alas!</span><span id="en8236"> Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8237"> "By the cathedral door," said Miss Pross.</span><span id="en8238"> "Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8239"> "No, miss," answered Mr.</span><span id="en8240"> Cruncher.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8241"> "Then, like the best of men," said Miss Pross, "go to the posting-house straight, and make that change."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8242"> "I am doubtful," said Mr.</span><span id="en8243"> Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, "about leaving of you, you see.</span><span id="en8244"> We don't know what may happen."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8245"> "Heaven knows we don't," returned Miss Pross, "but have no fear for me.</span><span id="en8246"> Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here.</span><span id="en8247"> I feel certain of it.</span><span id="en8248"> There!</span><span id="en8249"> Bless you, Mr.</span><span id="en8250"> Cruncher!</span><span id="en8251"> Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8252"> This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr.</span><span id="en8253"> Cruncher.</span><span id="en8254"> With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8255"> The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross.</span><span id="en8256"> The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief.</span><span id="en8257"> She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two.</span><span id="en8258"> She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8259"> Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollen and red.</span><span id="en8260"> Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her.</span><span id="en8261"> In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8262"> The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en8263"> By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8264"> Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, "The wife of Evremonde; where is she?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8265"> It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight.</span><span id="en8266"> Her first act was to shut them.</span><span id="en8267"> There were four in the room, and she shut them all.</span><span id="en8268"> She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8269"> Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished.</span><span id="en8270"> Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8271"> "You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer," said Miss Pross, in her breathing.</span><span id="en8272"> "Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me.</span><span id="en8273"> I am an Englishwoman."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8274"> Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay.</span><span id="en8275"> She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr.</span><span id="en8276"> Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by.</span><span id="en8277"> She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8278"> "On my way yonder," said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, "where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing.</span><span id="en8279"> I wish to see her."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8280"> "I know that your intentions are evil," said Miss Pross, "and you may depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8281"> Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8282"> "It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment," said Madame Defarge.</span><span id="en8283"> "Good patriots will know what that means.</span><span id="en8284"> Let me see her.</span><span id="en8285"> Go tell her that I wish to see her.</span><span id="en8286"> Do you hear?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8287"> "If those eyes of yours were bed-winches," returned Miss Pross, "and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me.</span><span id="en8288"> No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8289"> Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8290"> "Woman imbecile and pig-like!"</span><span id="en8291"> said Madame Defarge, frowning.</span><span id="en8292"> "I take no answer from you.</span><span id="en8293"> I demand to see her.</span><span id="en8294"> Either tell her that I demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!"</span><span id="en8295"> This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8296"> "I little thought," said Miss Pross, "that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8297"> Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes.</span><span id="en8298"> Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8299"> "I am a Briton," said Miss Pross, "I am desperate.</span><span id="en8300"> I don't care an English Twopence for myself.</span><span id="en8301"> I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird.</span><span id="en8302"> I'll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8303"> Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.</span><span id="en8304"> Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8305"> But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes.</span><span id="en8306"> This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness.</span><span id="en8307"> "Ha, ha!"</span><span id="en8308"> she laughed, "you poor wretch!</span><span id="en8309"> What are you worth!</span><span id="en8310"> I address myself to that Doctor."</span><span id="en8311"> Then she raised her voice and called out, "Citizen Doctor!</span><span id="en8312"> Wife of Evremonde!</span><span id="en8313"> Child of Evremonde!</span><span id="en8314"> Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8315"> Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.</span><span id="en8316"> Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8317"> "Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground.</span><span id="en8318"> There is no one in that room behind you!</span><span id="en8319"> Let me look."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8320"> "Never!"</span><span id="en8321"> said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8322"> "If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back," said Madame Defarge to herself.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8323"> "As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do," said Miss Pross to herself; "and you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8324"> "I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door," said Madame Defarge.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8325"> "We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling," said Miss Pross.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8326"> Madame Defarge made at the door.</span><span id="en8327"> Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.</span><span id="en8328"> It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had.</span><span id="en8329"> The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8330"> Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist.</span><span id="en8331"> "It is under my arm," said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, "you shall not draw it.</span><span id="en8332"> I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it.</span><span id="en8333"> I hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8334"> Madame Defarge's hands were at her bosom.</span><span id="en8335"> Miss Pross looked up, saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood alone—blinded with smoke.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8336"> All this was in a second.</span><span id="en8337"> As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8338"> In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help.</span><span id="en8339"> Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back.</span><span id="en8340"> It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear.</span><span id="en8341"> These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key.</span><span id="en8342"> She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8343"> By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped.</span><span id="en8344"> By good fortune, too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman.</span><span id="en8345"> She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8346"> In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river.</span><span id="en8347"> Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder!</span><span id="en8348"> In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8349"> "Is there any noise in the streets?"</span><span id="en8350"> she asked him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8351"> "The usual noises," Mr.</span><span id="en8352"> Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8353"> "I don't hear you," said Miss Pross.</span><span id="en8354"> "What do you say?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8355"> It was in vain for Mr.</span><span id="en8356"> Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him.</span><span id="en8357"> "So I'll nod my head," thought Mr.</span><span id="en8358"> Cruncher, amazed, "at all events she'll see that."</span><span id="en8359"> And she did.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8360"> "Is there any noise in the streets now?"</span><span id="en8361"> asked Miss Pross again, presently.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8362"> Again Mr.</span><span id="en8363"> Cruncher nodded his head.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8364"> "I don't hear it."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8365"> "Gone deaf in an hour?"</span><span id="en8366"> said Mr.</span><span id="en8367"> Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind much disturbed; "wot's come to her?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8368"> "I feel," said Miss Pross, "as if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8369"> "Blest if she ain't in a queer condition!"</span><span id="en8370"> said Mr.</span><span id="en8371"> Cruncher, more and more disturbed.</span><span id="en8372"> "Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up?</span><span id="en8373"> Hark!</span><span id="en8374"> There's the roll of them dreadful carts!</span><span id="en8375"> You can hear that, miss?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8376"> "I can hear," said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, "nothing.</span><span id="en8377"> O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8378"> "If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journey's end," said Mr.</span><span id="en8379"> Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, "it's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8380"> And indeed she never did.</span></p>

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@98@98-h@98-h-15_htm_html_pgepubid00049">XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever</h2>
<p><span id="en8381"> Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh.</span><span id="en8382"> Six tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine.</span><span id="en8383"> All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine.</span><span id="en8384"> And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror.</span><span id="en8385"> Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms.</span><span id="en8386"> Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8387"> Six tumbrils roll along the streets.</span><span id="en8388"> Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!</span><span id="en8389"> No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator, never reverses his transformations.</span><span id="en8390"> "If thou be changed into this shape by the will of God," say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, "then remain so!</span><span id="en8391"> But, if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!"</span><span id="en8392"> Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8393"> As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets.</span><span id="en8394"> Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.</span><span id="en8395"> So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils.</span><span id="en8396"> Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight; then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8397"> Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men.</span><span id="en8398"> Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures.</span><span id="en8399"> Several close their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together.</span><span id="en8400"> Only one, and he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance.</span><span id="en8401"> Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8402"> There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils, and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some question.</span><span id="en8403"> It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart.</span><span id="en8404"> The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords.</span><span id="en8405"> The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand.</span><span id="en8406"> He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl.</span><span id="en8407"> Here and there in the long street of St.</span><span id="en8408"> Honore, cries are raised against him.</span><span id="en8409"> If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face.</span><span id="en8410"> He cannot easily touch his face, his arms being bound.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8411"> On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands the Spy and prison-sheep.</span><span id="en8412"> He looks into the first of them: not there.</span><span id="en8413"> He looks into the second: not there.</span><span id="en8414"> He already asks himself, "Has he sacrificed me?"</span><span id="en8415"> when his face clears, as he looks into the third.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8416"> "Which is Evremonde?"</span><span id="en8417"> says a man behind him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8418"> "That.</span><span id="en8419"> At the back there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8420"> "With his hand in the girl's?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8421"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8422"> The man cries, "Down, Evremonde!</span><span id="en8423"> To the Guillotine all aristocrats!</span><span id="en8424"> Down, Evremonde!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8425"> "Hush, hush!"</span><span id="en8426"> the Spy entreats him, timidly.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8427"> "And why not, citizen?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8428"> "He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.</span><span id="en8429"> Let him be at peace."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8430"> But the man continuing to exclaim, "Down, Evremonde!"</span><span id="en8431"> the face of Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him.</span><span id="en8432"> Evremonde then sees the Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8433"> The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and end.</span><span id="en8434"> The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following to the Guillotine.</span><span id="en8435"> In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting.</span><span id="en8436"> On one of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8437"> "Therese!"</span><span id="en8438"> she cries, in her shrill tones.</span><span id="en8439"> "Who has seen her?</span><span id="en8440"> Therese Defarge!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8441"> "She never missed before," says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8442"> "No; nor will she miss now," cries The Vengeance, petulantly.</span><span id="en8443"> "Therese."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8444"> "Louder," the woman recommends.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8445"> Ay!</span><span id="en8446"> Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear thee.</span><span id="en8447"> Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet it will hardly bring her.</span><span id="en8448"> Send other women up and down to seek her, lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her!</span></p>
<p><span id="en8449"> "Bad Fortune!"</span><span id="en8450"> cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, "and here are the tumbrils!</span><span id="en8451"> And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and she not here!</span><span id="en8452"> See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for her.</span><span id="en8453"> I cry with vexation and disappointment!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8454"> As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads.</span><span id="en8455"> The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready.</span><span id="en8456"> Crash!</span><span id="en8457"> —A head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8458"> The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up.</span><span id="en8459"> Crash!</span><span id="en8460"> —And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8461"> The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next after him.</span><span id="en8462"> He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but still holds it as he promised.</span><span id="en8463"> He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into his face and thanks him.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8464"> "But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort here to-day.</span><span id="en8465"> I think you were sent to me by Heaven."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8466"> "Or you to me," says Sydney Carton.</span><span id="en8467"> "Keep your eyes upon me, dear child, and mind no other object."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8468"> "I mind nothing while I hold your hand.</span><span id="en8469"> I shall mind nothing when I let it go, if they are rapid."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8470"> "They will be rapid.</span><span id="en8471"> Fear not!"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8472"> The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as if they were alone.</span><span id="en8473"> Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her bosom.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8474"> "Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question?</span><span id="en8475"> I am very ignorant, and it troubles me—just a little."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8476"> "Tell me what it is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8477"> "I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I love very dearly.</span><span id="en8478"> She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a farmer's house in the south country.</span><span id="en8479"> Poverty parted us, and she knows nothing of my fate—for I cannot write—and if I could, how should I tell her!</span><span id="en8480"> It is better as it is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8481"> "Yes, yes: better as it is."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8482"> "What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support, is this:—If the Republic really does good to the poor, and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may live a long time: she may even live to be old."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8483"> "What then, my gentle sister?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8484"> "Do you think:" the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble: "that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8485"> "It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8486"> "You comfort me so much!</span><span id="en8487"> I am so ignorant.</span><span id="en8488"> Am I to kiss you now?</span><span id="en8489"> Is the moment come?"</span></p>
<p><span id="en8490"> "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8491"> She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.</span><span id="en8492"> The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face.</span><span id="en8493"> She goes next before him—is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8494"> "I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."</span></p>
<p><span id="en8495"> The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.</span><span id="en8496"> Twenty-Three.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span id="en8497"> They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peacefullest man's face ever beheld there.</span><span id="en8498"> Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8499"> One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe—a woman—had asked at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8500"> "I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use.</span><span id="en8501"> I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8502"> "I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more.</span><span id="en8503"> I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name.</span><span id="en8504"> I see her father, aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace.</span><span id="en8505"> I see the good old man, so long their friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8506"> "I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence.</span><span id="en8507"> I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day.</span><span id="en8508"> I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul, than I was in the souls of both.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8509"> "I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine.</span><span id="en8510"> I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his.</span><span id="en8511"> I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away.</span><span id="en8512"> I see him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place—then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement—and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.</span></p>
<p><span id="en8513"> "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."</span></p>
