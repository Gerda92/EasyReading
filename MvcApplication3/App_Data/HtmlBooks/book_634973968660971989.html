<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br>
<br></div>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en50">High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="en51">  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en52">He was very much admired indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="en53">  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,” remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en54">“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince? </span><span class="sentence" id="en55">” asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="en56">  “The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="en57">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en58">“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en59">“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en60">“How do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="en61">” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen one. </span><span class="sentence" id="en62">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en63">“Ah!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en64">but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en65">One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en66">  His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. </span><span class="sentence" id="en67">  He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en68">“Shall I love you? </span><span class="sentence" id="en69">” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en70">  So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. </span><span class="sentence" id="en71">  This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en72">“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has no money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="en73">  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en74">After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. </span><span class="sentence" id="en75">  “She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind. </span><span class="sentence" id="en76">”  And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. </span><span class="sentence" id="en77">  “I admit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also. </span><span class="sentence" id="en78">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en79">“Will you come away with me? </span><span class="sentence" id="en80">” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en81">“You have been trifling with me,” he cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="en82">  “I am off to the Pyramids. </span><span class="sentence" id="en83">  Good-bye! </span><span class="sentence" id="en84">” and he flew away. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en85">All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. </span><span class="sentence" id="en86">  “Where shall I put up? </span><span class="sentence" id="en87">” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations. </span><span class="sentence" id="en88">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en89">Then he saw the statue on the tall column. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en90">“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="en91">”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en92">“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en93">  “What a curious thing! </span><span class="sentence" id="en94">” he cried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="en95">  The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="en96">  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness. </span><span class="sentence" id="en97">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en98">Then another drop fell. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en99">“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off? </span><span class="sentence" id="en100">” he said; “I must look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en101">But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw—Ah!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en102">what did he see? </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en103">The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="en104">  His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en105">“Who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="en106">” he said. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en107">“I am the Happy Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="en108">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en109">“Why are you weeping then? </span><span class="sentence" id="en110">” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched me. </span><span class="sentence" id="en111">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en112">“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="en113">  In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. </span><span class="sentence" id="en114">  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="en115">  My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="en116">  So I lived, and so I died. </span><span class="sentence" id="en117">  And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep. </span><span class="sentence" id="en118">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en119">“What!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en120">is he not solid gold? </span><span class="sentence" id="en121">” said the Swallow to himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en122">  He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en123">“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a little street there is a poor house. </span><span class="sentence" id="en124">  One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. </span><span class="sentence" id="en125">  Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="en126">  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="en127">  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="en128">  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. </span><span class="sentence" id="en129">  His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="en130">  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? </span><span class="sentence" id="en131">  My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move. </span><span class="sentence" id="en132">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en133">“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en134">  “My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="en135">  Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. </span><span class="sentence" id="en136">  The King is there himself in his painted coffin. </span><span class="sentence" id="en137">  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. </span><span class="sentence" id="en138">  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="en139">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en140">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? </span><span class="sentence" id="en141">  The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="en142">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en143">“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en144">  “Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons, who were always throwing stones at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="en145">  They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect. </span><span class="sentence" id="en146">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en147">But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="en148">  “It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger. </span><span class="sentence" id="en149">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en150">“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en151">So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en152">He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. </span><span class="sentence" id="en153">  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en154">  A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. </span><span class="sentence" id="en155">  “How wonderful the stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love! </span><span class="sentence" id="en156">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en157">“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered; “I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en158">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en159">He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships. </span><span class="sentence" id="en160">  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales. </span><span class="sentence" id="en161">  At last he came to the poor house and looked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="en162">  The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="en163">  In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble. </span><span class="sentence" id="en164">  Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his wings. </span><span class="sentence" id="en165">  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and he sank into a delicious slumber. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en166">Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="en167">  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="en168">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en169">“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="en170">  And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="en171">  Thinking always made him sleepy. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en172">When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. </span><span class="sentence" id="en173">  “What a remarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. </span><span class="sentence" id="en174">  “A swallow in winter! </span><span class="sentence" id="en175">”  And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="en176">  Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en177">“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="en178">  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple. </span><span class="sentence" id="en179">  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger! </span><span class="sentence" id="en180">” so he enjoyed himself very much. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en181">When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="en182">  “Have you any commissions for Egypt? </span><span class="sentence" id="en183">” he cried; “I am just starting. </span><span class="sentence" id="en184">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en185">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer? </span><span class="sentence" id="en186">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en187">“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en188">  “To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract. </span><span class="sentence" id="en189">  The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon. </span><span class="sentence" id="en190">  All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="en191">  At noon the yellow lions come down to the water’s edge to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="en192">  They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en193">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the city I see a young man in a garret. </span><span class="sentence" id="en194">  He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. </span><span class="sentence" id="en195">  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="en196">  He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="en197">  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="en198">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en199">“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had a good heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="en200">  “Shall I take him another ruby? </span><span class="sentence" id="en201">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en202">“Alas! </span><span class="sentence" id="en203">  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I have left. </span><span class="sentence" id="en204">  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="en205">  Pluck out one of them and take it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en206">  He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play. </span><span class="sentence" id="en207">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en208">“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to weep. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en209">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you. </span><span class="sentence" id="en210">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en211">So the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the student’s garret. </span><span class="sentence" id="en212">  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof. </span><span class="sentence" id="en213">  Through this he darted, and came into the room. </span><span class="sentence" id="en214">  The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en215">“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great admirer. </span><span class="sentence" id="en216">  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en217">The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. </span><span class="sentence" id="en218">  He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. </span><span class="sentence" id="en219">  “Heave a-hoy! </span><span class="sentence" id="en220">” they shouted as each chest came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="en221">  “I am going to Egypt”!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en222">cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en223">“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en224">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer? </span><span class="sentence" id="en225">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en226">“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="en227">  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="en228">  My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="en229">  Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. </span><span class="sentence" id="en230">  The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea. </span><span class="sentence" id="en231">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en232">“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little match-girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="en233">  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="en234">  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="en235">  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. </span><span class="sentence" id="en236">  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her. </span><span class="sentence" id="en237">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en238">“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot pluck out your eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="en239">  You would be quite blind then. </span><span class="sentence" id="en240">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en241">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you. </span><span class="sentence" id="en242">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en243">So he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en244">  He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="en245">  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en246">Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="en247">  “You are blind now,” he said, “so I will stay with you always. </span><span class="sentence" id="en248">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en249">“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt. </span><span class="sentence" id="en250">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en251">“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince’s feet. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en252">All the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. </span><span class="sentence" id="en253">  He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en254">“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="en255">  There is no Mystery so great as Misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="en256">  Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there. </span><span class="sentence" id="en257">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en258">So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. </span><span class="sentence" id="en259">  He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. </span><span class="sentence" id="en260">  Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep themselves warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="en261">  “How hungry we are! </span><span class="sentence" id="en262">” they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="en263">  “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en264">Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en265">“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en266">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en267">Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. </span><span class="sentence" id="en268">  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. </span><span class="sentence" id="en269">  “We have bread now! </span><span class="sentence" id="en270">” they cried. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en271">Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. </span><span class="sentence" id="en272">  The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en273">The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="en274">  He picked up crumbs outside the baker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en275">But at last he knew that he was going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="en276">  He had just strength to fly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more. </span><span class="sentence" id="en277">  “Good-bye, dear Prince! </span><span class="sentence" id="en278">” he murmured, “will you let me kiss your hand? </span><span class="sentence" id="en279">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en280">“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you. </span><span class="sentence" id="en281">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en282">“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en283">  “I am going to the House of Death. </span><span class="sentence" id="en284">  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not? </span><span class="sentence" id="en285">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en286">And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en287">At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="en288">  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. </span><span class="sentence" id="en289">  It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en290">Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. </span><span class="sentence" id="en291">  As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: “Dear me!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en292">how shabby the Happy Prince looks! </span><span class="sentence" id="en293">” he said. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en294">“How shabby indeed! </span><span class="sentence" id="en295">” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en296">“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle beter than a beggar! </span><span class="sentence" id="en297">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en298">“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en299">“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet! </span><span class="sentence" id="en300">” continued the Mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="en301">  “We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here. </span><span class="sentence" id="en302">”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en303">So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="en304">  “As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the University. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en305">Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="en306">  “We must have another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en307">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en308">“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="en309">  When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en310">“What a strange thing! </span><span class="sentence" id="en311">” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="en312">  “This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. </span><span class="sentence" id="en313">  We must throw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="en314">”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en315">“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en316">“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me. </span><span class="sentence" id="en317">” </span></p>

<h2 id="ch-en318"><span class="sentence" id="en318">THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE </span></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br>
<br></div>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en319">“She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,” cried the young Student; “but in all my garden there is no red rose. </span><span class="sentence" id="en320">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en321">From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en322">“No red rose in all my garden! </span><span class="sentence" id="en323">” he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="en324">  “Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! </span><span class="sentence" id="en325">  I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched. </span><span class="sentence" id="en326">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en327">“Here at last is a true lover,” said the Nightingale. </span><span class="sentence" id="en328">  “Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en329">  His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en330">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en331">“The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young Student, “and my love will be of the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="en332">  If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="en333">  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="en334">  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. </span><span class="sentence" id="en335">  She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break. </span><span class="sentence" id="en336">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en337">“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale. </span><span class="sentence" id="en338">  “What I sing of, he suffers—what is joy to me, to him is pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="en339">  Surely Love is a wonderful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en340">  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. </span><span class="sentence" id="en341">  Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="en342">  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="en343">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en344">“The musicians will sit in their gallery,” said the young Student, “and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="en345">  She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her. </span><span class="sentence" id="en346">  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her”; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en347">“Why is he weeping? </span><span class="sentence" id="en348">” asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en349">“Why, indeed? </span><span class="sentence" id="en350">” said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en351">“Why, indeed? </span><span class="sentence" id="en352">” whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en353">“He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en354">“For a red rose? </span><span class="sentence" id="en355">” they cried; “how very ridiculous! </span><span class="sentence" id="en356">” and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en357">But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student’s sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en358">Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. </span><span class="sentence" id="en359">  She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en360">In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en361">“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song. </span><span class="sentence" id="en362">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en363">But the Tree shook its head. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en364">“My roses are white,” it answered; “as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain. </span><span class="sentence" id="en365">  But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="en366">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en367">So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en368">“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song. </span><span class="sentence" id="en369">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en370">But the Tree shook its head. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en371">“My roses are yellow,” it answered; “as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe. </span><span class="sentence" id="en372">  But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student’s window, and perhaps he will give you what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="en373">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en374">So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student’s window. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en375">“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song. </span><span class="sentence" id="en376">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en377">But the Tree shook its head. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en378">“My roses are red,” it answered, “as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern. </span><span class="sentence" id="en379">  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year. </span><span class="sentence" id="en380">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en381">“One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, “only one red rose! </span><span class="sentence" id="en382">  Is there no way by which I can get it? </span><span class="sentence" id="en383">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en384">“There is away,” answered the Tree; “but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="en385">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en386">“Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, “I am not afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="en387">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en388">“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="en389">  You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="en390">  All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="en391">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en392">“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale, “and Life is very dear to all. </span><span class="sentence" id="en393">  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl. </span><span class="sentence" id="en394">  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill. </span><span class="sentence" id="en395">  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man? </span><span class="sentence" id="en396">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en397">So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. </span><span class="sentence" id="en398">  She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en399">The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en400">“Be happy,” cried the Nightingale, “be happy; you shall have your red rose. </span><span class="sentence" id="en401">  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart’s-blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="en402">  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty. </span><span class="sentence" id="en403">  Flame-coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body. </span><span class="sentence" id="en404">  His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense. </span><span class="sentence" id="en405">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en406">The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en407">But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en408">“Sing me one last song,” he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely when you are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="en409">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en410">So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en411">When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en412">“She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove—“that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling? </span><span class="sentence" id="en413">  I am afraid not. </span><span class="sentence" id="en414">  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity. </span><span class="sentence" id="en415">  She would not sacrifice herself for others. </span><span class="sentence" id="en416">  She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish. </span><span class="sentence" id="en417">  Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="en418">  What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good. </span><span class="sentence" id="en419">”  And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en420">And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="en421">  All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="en422">  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en423">She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="en424">  And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song. </span><span class="sentence" id="en425">  Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="en426">  As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en427">But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="en428">  “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come before the rose is finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="en429">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en430">So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en431">And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride. </span><span class="sentence" id="en432">  But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose’s heart remained white, for only a Nightingale’s heart’s-blood can crimson the heart of a rose. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en433">And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="en434">  “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come before the rose is finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="en435">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en436">So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her. </span><span class="sentence" id="en437">  Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en438">And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky. </span><span class="sentence" id="en439">  Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en440">But the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="en441">  Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en442">Then she gave one last burst of music. </span><span class="sentence" id="en443">  The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky. </span><span class="sentence" id="en444">  The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air. </span><span class="sentence" id="en445">  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="en446">  It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en447">“Look, look! </span><span class="sentence" id="en448">” cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now”; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en449">And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en450">“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck! </span><span class="sentence" id="en451">” he cried; “here is a red rose! </span><span class="sentence" id="en452">  I have never seen any rose like it in all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="en453">  It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name”; and he leaned down and plucked it. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en454">Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor’s house with the rose in his hand. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en455">The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en456">“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,” cried the Student. </span><span class="sentence" id="en457">  “Here is the reddest rose in all the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="en458">  You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you. </span><span class="sentence" id="en459">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en460">But the girl frowned. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en461">“I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she answered; “and, besides, the Chamberlain’s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="en462">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en463">“Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,” said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en464">“Ungrateful! </span><span class="sentence" id="en465">” said the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="en466">  “I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="en467">  Only a Student. </span><span class="sentence" id="en468">  Why, I don’t believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain’s nephew has”; and she got up from her chair and went into the house. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en469">“What I a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="en470">  “It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="en471">  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics. </span><span class="sentence" id="en472">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en473">So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read. </span></p>

<h2 id="ch-en474"><span class="sentence" id="en474">THE SELFISH GIANT </span></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br>
<br></div>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en475">Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant’s garden. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en476">It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. </span><span class="sentence" id="en477">  Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="en478">  The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="en479">  “How happy we are here! </span><span class="sentence" id="en480">” they cried to each other. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en481">One day the Giant came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="en482">  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. </span><span class="sentence" id="en483">  After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. </span><span class="sentence" id="en484">  When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en485">“What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="en486">” he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en487">“My own garden is my own garden,” said the Giant; “any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en488">”  So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board. </span></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br></div>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en489">TRESPASSERS </span><br><span class="sentence" id="en490">

PROSECUTED </span></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br></div>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en492">He was a very selfish Giant. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en493">The poor children had now nowhere to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="en494">  They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en495">  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="en496">  “How happy we were there,” they said to each other. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en497">Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. </span><span class="sentence" id="en498">  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="en499">  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. </span><span class="sentence" id="en500">  Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="en501">  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. </span><span class="sentence" id="en502">  “Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all the year round. </span><span class="sentence" id="en503">”  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="en504">  Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="en505">  He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. </span><span class="sentence" id="en506">  “This is a delightful spot,” he said, “we must ask the Hail on a visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="en507">”  So the Hail came. </span><span class="sentence" id="en508">  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="en509">  He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en510">“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; “I hope there will be a change in the weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="en511">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en512">But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="en513">  The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant’s garden she gave none. </span><span class="sentence" id="en514">  “He is too selfish,” she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="en515">  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en516">One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. </span><span class="sentence" id="en517">  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King’s musicians passing by. </span><span class="sentence" id="en518">  It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="en519">  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. </span><span class="sentence" id="en520">  “I believe the Spring has come at last,” said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en521">What did he see? </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en522">He saw a most wonderful sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="en523">  Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. </span><span class="sentence" id="en524">  In every tree that he could see there was a little child. </span><span class="sentence" id="en525">  And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children’s heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="en526">  The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en527">  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="en528">  It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en529">  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. </span><span class="sentence" id="en530">  The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en531">  “Climb up!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en532">little boy,” said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en533">And the Giant’s heart melted as he looked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="en534">  “How selfish I have been! </span><span class="sentence" id="en535">” he said; “now I know why the Spring would not come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="en536">  I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground for ever and ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="en537">”  He was really very sorry for what he had done. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en538">So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. </span><span class="sentence" id="en539">  But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. </span><span class="sentence" id="en540">  Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="en541">  And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="en542">  And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant’s neck, and kissed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en543">  And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="en544">  “It is your garden now, little children,” said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. </span><span class="sentence" id="en545">  And when the people were going to market at twelve o’clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en546">All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en547">“But where is your little companion? </span><span class="sentence" id="en548">” he said: “the boy I put into the tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="en549">”  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en550">“We don’t know,” answered the children; “he has gone away. </span><span class="sentence" id="en551">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en552">“You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,” said the Giant. </span><span class="sentence" id="en553">  But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en554">Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant. </span><span class="sentence" id="en555">  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="en556">  The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en557">  “How I would like to see him! </span><span class="sentence" id="en558">” he used to say. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en559">Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. </span><span class="sentence" id="en560">  He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden. </span><span class="sentence" id="en561">  “I have many beautiful flowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="en562">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en563">One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en564">  He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en565">Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="en566">  It certainly was a marvellous sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="en567">  In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. </span><span class="sentence" id="en568">  Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en569">Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. </span><span class="sentence" id="en570">  He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="en571">  And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to wound thee? </span><span class="sentence" id="en572">”  For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en573">“Who hath dared to wound thee? </span><span class="sentence" id="en574">” cried the Giant; “tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en575">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en576">“Nay! </span><span class="sentence" id="en577">” answered the child; “but these are the wounds of Love. </span><span class="sentence" id="en578">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en579">“Who art thou? </span><span class="sentence" id="en580">” said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en581">And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, “You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise. </span><span class="sentence" id="en582">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en583">And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms. </span></p>

<h2 id="ch-en584"><span class="sentence" id="en584">THE DEVOTED FRIEND </span></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br>
<br></div>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en585">One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. </span><span class="sentence" id="en586">  He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber. </span><span class="sentence" id="en587">  The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en588">“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="en589">  But the little ducks paid no attention to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="en590">  They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en591">“What disobedient children! </span><span class="sentence" id="en592">” cried the old Water-rat; “they really deserve to be drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="en593">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en594">“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="en595">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en596">“Ah!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en597">I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat; “I am not a family man. </span><span class="sentence" id="en598">  In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="en599">  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher. </span><span class="sentence" id="en600">  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="en601">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en602">“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend? </span><span class="sentence" id="en603">” asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en604">“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en605">“What a silly question! </span><span class="sentence" id="en606">” cried the Water-rat. </span><span class="sentence" id="en607">  “I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="en608">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en609">“And what would you do in return? </span><span class="sentence" id="en610">” said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en611">“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en612">“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en613">“Is the story about me? </span><span class="sentence" id="en614">” asked the Water-rat. </span><span class="sentence" id="en615">  “If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="en616">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en617">“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en618">“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow named Hans. </span><span class="sentence" id="en619">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en620">“Was he very distinguished? </span><span class="sentence" id="en621">” asked the Water-rat. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en622">“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face. </span><span class="sentence" id="en623">  He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden. </span><span class="sentence" id="en624">  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his. </span><span class="sentence" id="en625">  Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and Fair-maids of France. </span><span class="sentence" id="en626">  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. </span><span class="sentence" id="en627">  Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en628">“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller. </span><span class="sentence" id="en629">  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en630">“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en631">“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en632">“So little Hans worked away in his garden. </span><span class="sentence" id="en633">  During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="en634">  In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en635">“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="en636">  That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right. </span><span class="sentence" id="en637">  So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en638">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en639">“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very thoughtful indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="en640">  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="en641">  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="en642">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en643">“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here? </span><span class="sentence" id="en644">’ said the Miller’s youngest son. </span><span class="sentence" id="en645">  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits. </span><span class="sentence" id="en646">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en647">“‘What a silly boy you are’!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en648">cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what is the use of sending you to school. </span><span class="sentence" id="en649">  You seem not to learn anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="en650">  Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="en651">  I certainly will not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="en652">  I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations. </span><span class="sentence" id="en653">  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="en654">  Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="en655">  Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="en656">  Everybody can see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="en657">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en658">“‘How well you talk’!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en659">said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en660">  It is just like being in church. </span><span class="sentence" id="en661">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en662">“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="en663">  However, he was so young that you must excuse him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en664">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en665">“Is that the end of the story? </span><span class="sentence" id="en666">” asked the Water-rat. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en667">“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="en668">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en669">“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat. </span><span class="sentence" id="en670">  “Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="en671">  That is the new method. </span><span class="sentence" id="en672">  I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="en673">  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh! </span><span class="sentence" id="en674">’  But pray go on with your story. </span><span class="sentence" id="en675">  I like the Miller immensely. </span><span class="sentence" id="en676">  I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="en677">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en678">“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en679">“‘Why, what a good heart you have’!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en680">cried his Wife; ‘you are always thinking of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="en681">  And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="en682">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en683">“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en684">“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en685">“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en686">“‘And how have you been all the winter? </span><span class="sentence" id="en687">’ said the Miller. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en688">“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="en689">  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well. </span><span class="sentence" id="en690">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en691">“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and wondered how you were getting on. </span><span class="sentence" id="en692">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en693">“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten me. </span><span class="sentence" id="en694">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en695">“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never forgets. </span><span class="sentence" id="en696">  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t understand the poetry of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="en697">  How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye”! </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en698">“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many. </span><span class="sentence" id="en699">  I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="en700">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en701">“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow? </span><span class="sentence" id="en702">  You don’t mean to say you have sold it? </span><span class="sentence" id="en703">  What a very stupid thing to do’! </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en704">“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to. </span><span class="sentence" id="en705">  You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with. </span><span class="sentence" id="en706">  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en707">  But I am going to buy them all back again now. </span><span class="sentence" id="en708">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en709">“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en710">  It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="en711">  I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="en712">  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en713">  Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en714">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en715">“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="en716">  ‘I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house. </span><span class="sentence" id="en717">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en718">“‘A plank of wood’!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en719">said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn. </span><span class="sentence" id="en720">  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don’t stop it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="en721">  How lucky you mentioned it! </span><span class="sentence" id="en722">  It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another. </span><span class="sentence" id="en723">  I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank. </span><span class="sentence" id="en724">  Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="en725">  Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day. </span><span class="sentence" id="en726">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en727">“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en728">“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="en729">  And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return. </span><span class="sentence" id="en730">  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full. </span><span class="sentence" id="en731">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en732">“‘Quite full? </span><span class="sentence" id="en733">’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en734">“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="en735">  I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="en736">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en737">“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden. </span><span class="sentence" id="en738">  I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller’s basket. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en739">“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en740">“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en741">“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road. </span><span class="sentence" id="en742">  So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en743">“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en744">“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market? </span><span class="sentence" id="en745">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en746">“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day. </span><span class="sentence" id="en747">  I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll. </span><span class="sentence" id="en748">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en749">“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="en750">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en751">“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for the whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en752">“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="en753">  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market. </span><span class="sentence" id="en754">  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en755">“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en756">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en757">“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en758">“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en759">  Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="en760">  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish. </span><span class="sentence" id="en761">  You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="en762">  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="en763">  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means? </span><span class="sentence" id="en764">  Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="en765">  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good. </span><span class="sentence" id="en766">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en767">“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en768">  Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing? </span><span class="sentence" id="en769">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en770">“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the back, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="en771">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en772">“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en773">“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy? </span><span class="sentence" id="en774">’ he inquired in a shy and timid voice. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en775">“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en776">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en777">“‘Oh!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en778">on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and dressed himself, and went up to the barn. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en779">“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to see how he was getting on. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en780">“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans? </span><span class="sentence" id="en781">’ cried the Miller in a cheery voice. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en782">“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en783">“‘Ah’!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en784">said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others. </span><span class="sentence" id="en785">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en786">“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege. </span><span class="sentence" id="en787">  But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="en788">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en789">“‘Oh!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en790">they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more pains. </span><span class="sentence" id="en791">  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also. </span><span class="sentence" id="en792">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en793">“‘Do you really think I shall? </span><span class="sentence" id="en794">’ asked little Hans. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en795">“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="en796">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en797">“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain. </span><span class="sentence" id="en798">  It took him the whole day to get there and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en799">“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went to work at once. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en800">“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill. </span><span class="sentence" id="en801">  Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="en802">  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="en803">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en804">“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en805">“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door. </span><span class="sentence" id="en806">  It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm. </span><span class="sentence" id="en807">  But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en808">“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en809">“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en810">“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="en811">  My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="en812">  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="en813">  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return. </span><span class="sentence" id="en814">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en815">“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="en816">  But you must lend me your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the ditch. </span><span class="sentence" id="en817">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en818">“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en819">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en820">“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler round his throat, and started off. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en821">“What a dreadful storm it was! </span><span class="sentence" id="en822">  The night was so black that little Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="en823">  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the door. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en824">“‘Who is there? </span><span class="sentence" id="en825">’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en826">“‘Little Hans, Doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="en827">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en828">“’What do you want, little Hans? </span><span class="sentence" id="en829">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en830">“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="en831">’ </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en832">“‘All right! </span><span class="sentence" id="en833">’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en834">“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="en835">  At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="en836">  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en837">“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en838">“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I should have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en839">“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en840">“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en841">  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en842">  I will certainly take care not to give away anything again. </span><span class="sentence" id="en843">  One always suffers for being generous. </span><span class="sentence" id="en844">’” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en845">“Well? </span><span class="sentence" id="en846">” said the Water-rat, after a long pause. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en847">“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en848">“But what became of the Miller? </span><span class="sentence" id="en849">” asked the Water-rat. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en850">“Oh! </span><span class="sentence" id="en851">  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I don’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="en852">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en853">“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said the Water-rat. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en854">“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the Linnet. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en855">“The what? </span><span class="sentence" id="en856">” screamed the Water-rat. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en857">“The moral. </span><span class="sentence" id="en858">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en859">“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral? </span><span class="sentence" id="en860">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en861">“Certainly,” said the Linnet. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en862">“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you should have told me that before you began. </span><span class="sentence" id="en863">  If you had done so, I certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said ‘Pooh,’ like the critic. </span><span class="sentence" id="en864">  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out “Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en865">“And how do you like the Water-rat? </span><span class="sentence" id="en866">” asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="en867">  “He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="en868">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en869">“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet. </span><span class="sentence" id="en870">  “The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral. </span><span class="sentence" id="en871">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en872">“Ah!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en873">that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en874">And I quite agree with her. </span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="en876">The King’s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. </span><span class="sentence" id="en877">  He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="en878">  She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer. </span><span class="sentence" id="en879">  The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en880">  Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="en881">  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered. </span><span class="sentence" id="en882">  “She is like a white rose! </span><span class="sentence" id="en883">” they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en884">At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her. </span><span class="sentence" id="en885">  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="en886">  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en887">“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful than your picture”; and the little Princess blushed. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en888">“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour, “but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en889">For the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s salary was to be doubled. </span><span class="sentence" id="en890">  As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en891">When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="en892">  It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls. </span><span class="sentence" id="en893">  Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="en894">  The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal. </span><span class="sentence" id="en895">  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en896">“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as clear as crystal! </span><span class="sentence" id="en897">” and the King doubled his salary a second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="en898">  “What an honour! </span><span class="sentence" id="en899">” cried all the courtiers. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en900">After the banquet there was to be a Ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="en901">  The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute. </span><span class="sentence" id="en902">  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King. </span><span class="sentence" id="en903">  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en904">charming! </span><span class="sentence" id="en905">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en906">The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="en907">  The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en908">“What are fireworks like? </span><span class="sentence" id="en909">” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en910">“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural. </span><span class="sentence" id="en911">  I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en912">  You must certainly see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="en913">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en914">So at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en915">“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib. </span><span class="sentence" id="en916">  “Just look at those yellow tulips. </span><span class="sentence" id="en917">  Why!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en918">if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier. </span><span class="sentence" id="en919">  I am very glad I have travelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="en920">  Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices. </span><span class="sentence" id="en921">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en922">“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman Candle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly. </span><span class="sentence" id="en923">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en924">“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en925">  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="en926">  True love suffers, and is silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="en927">  I remember myself once—But it is no matter now. </span><span class="sentence" id="en928">  Romance is a thing of the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="en929">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en930">“Nonsense! </span><span class="sentence" id="en931">” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies. </span><span class="sentence" id="en932">  It is like the moon, and lives for ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="en933">  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="en934">  I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news. </span><span class="sentence" id="en935">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en936">But the Catherine Wheel shook her head. </span><span class="sentence" id="en937">  “Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,” she murmured. </span><span class="sentence" id="en938">  She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en939">Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en940">It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end of a long stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="en941">  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en942">“Ahem!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en943">ahem! </span><span class="sentence" id="en944">” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="en945">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en946">“Order!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en947">order! </span><span class="sentence" id="en948">” cried out a Cracker. </span><span class="sentence" id="en949">  He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en950">“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en951">As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began. </span><span class="sentence" id="en952">  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="en953">  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en954">“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off. </span><span class="sentence" id="en955">  Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="en956">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en957">“Dear me! </span><span class="sentence" id="en958">” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour. </span><span class="sentence" id="en959">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en960">“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different. </span><span class="sentence" id="en961">  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="en962">  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en963">  When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="en964">  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder. </span><span class="sentence" id="en965">  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="en966">  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again. </span><span class="sentence" id="en967">  He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="en968">  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="en969">  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art. </span><span class="sentence" id="en970">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en971">“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister. </span><span class="sentence" id="en972">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en973">“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en974">“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="en975">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en976">“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en977">“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted. </span><span class="sentence" id="en978">  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="en979">  No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="en980">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en981">“What is a sensitive person? </span><span class="sentence" id="en982">” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en983">“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en984">“Pray, what are you laughing at? </span><span class="sentence" id="en985">” inquired the Rocket; “I am not laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en986">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en987">“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en988">“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily. </span><span class="sentence" id="en989">  “What right have you to be happy? </span><span class="sentence" id="en990">  You should be thinking about others. </span><span class="sentence" id="en991">  In fact, you should be thinking about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="en992">  I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="en993">  That is what is called sympathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en994">  It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="en995">  Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one! </span><span class="sentence" id="en996">  The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en997">  Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="en998">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en999">“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you had better keep yourself dry. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1000">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1001">“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits; “that is only common sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1002">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1003">“Common sense, indeed! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1004">” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1005">  Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1006">  But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1007">  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1008">  Fortunately for myself, I don’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1009">  The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1010">  But none of you have any hearts. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1011">  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1012">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1013">“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="en1014">  It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1015">  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1016">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1017">“Ah!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1018">what a trivial view of life! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1019">” said the Rocket; “but it is only what I expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1020">  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1021">  Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1022">  What a terrible misfortune! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1023">  Poor people, to lose their only son! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1024">  It is really too dreadful! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1025">  I shall never get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1026">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1027">“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no misfortune has happened to them at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1028">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1029">“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they might. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1030">  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1031">  I hate people who cry over spilt milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1032">  But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1033">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1034">“You certainly are! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1035">” cried the Bengal Light. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1036">  “In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1037">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1038">“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1039">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1040">“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1041">“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1042">  “I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1043">  It is a very dangerous thing to know one’s friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1044">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1045">“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1046">  “That is the important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1047">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1048">“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I shall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1049">“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1050">But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, “Humbug!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1051">humbug! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1052">” at the top of their voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1053">  They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1054">Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1055">The Prince and Princess were leading the dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1056">  They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1057">Then ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1058">“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1059">  He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1060">It was certainly a magnificent display. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1061">Whizz!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1062">Whizz!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1063">went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1064">  Boom! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1065">  Boom!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1066">went the Roman Candle. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1067">  Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1068">  “Good-bye,” cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1069">  Bang!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1070">Bang!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1071">answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1072">  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1073">  He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1074">  The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1075">  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1076">  Huzza!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1077">Huzza!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1078">cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1079">“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the Rocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious than ever. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1080">The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1081">  “This is evidently a deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming dignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1082">  But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1083">  Then one of them caught sight of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1084">  “Hallo! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1085">” he cried, “what a bad rocket! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1086">” and he threw him over the wall into the ditch. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1087">“BAD Rocket? </span><span class="sentence" id="en1088">  BAD Rocket? </span><span class="sentence" id="en1089">” he said, as he whirled through the air; “impossible! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1090">  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1091">  BAD and GRAND sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell into the mud. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1092">“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1093">  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1094">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1095">Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1096">“A new arrival, I see! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1097">” said the Frog. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1098">  “Well, after all there is nothing like mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1099">  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1100">  Do you think it will be a wet afternoon? </span><span class="sentence" id="en1101">  I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1102">  What a pity! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1103">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1104">“Ahem!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1105">ahem! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1106">” said the Rocket, and he began to cough. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1107">“What a delightful voice you have! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1108">” cried the Frog. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1109">  “Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1110">  You will hear our glee-club this evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1111">  We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1112">  It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1113">  In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1114">  It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1115">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1116">“Ahem!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1117">ahem! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1118">” said the Rocket angrily. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1119">  He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1120">“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will come over to the duck-pond. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1121">  I am off to look for my daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1122">  I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1123">  He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1124">  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1125">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1126">“Conversation, indeed! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1127">” said the Rocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1128">  “You have talked the whole time yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1129">  That is not conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1130">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1131">“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the talking myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1132">  It saves time, and prevents arguments. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1133">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1134">“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1135">“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1136">  “Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1137">  Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1138">“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1139">  I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1140">  It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1141">  In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1142">  Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1143">  I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1144">  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1145">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1146">“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1147">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1148">“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1149">  “I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1150">  I like hearing myself talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1151">  It is one of my greatest pleasures. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1152">  I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don’t understand a single word of what I am saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1153">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1154">“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1155">“How very silly of him not to stay here! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1156">” said the Rocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1157">  “I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1158">  However, I don’t care a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1159">  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1160">After some time a large White Duck swam up to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1161">  She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1162">“Quack, quack, quack,” she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1163">  “What a curious shape you are! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1164">  May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident? </span><span class="sentence" id="en1165">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1166">“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered the Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1167">  However, I excuse your ignorance. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1168">  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1169">  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1170">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1171">“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it is to any one. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1172">  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1173">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1174">“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I see that you belong to the lower orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1175">  A person of my position is never useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1176">  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1177">  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1178">  Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1179">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1180">“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1181">  I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1182">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1183">“Oh!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1184">dear no,” cried the Rocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1185">  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1186">  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1187">  There is neither society here, nor solitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1188">  In fact, it is essentially suburban. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1189">  I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1190">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1191">“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck; “there are so many things that need reforming. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1192">  Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1193">  However, they did not seem to have much effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1194">  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1195">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1196"> “I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1197">  Whenever we appear we excite great attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1198">  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1199">  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one’s mind from higher things. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1200">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1201">“Ah!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1202">the higher things of life, how fine they are! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1203">” said the Duck; “and that reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream, saying, “Quack, quack, quack. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1204">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1205">“Come back!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1206">come back! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1207">” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say to you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1208">  “I am glad that she has gone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1209">“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1210">“Hallo! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1211">” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1212">  I wonder how it came here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1213">“OLD Stick! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1214">” said the Rocket, “impossible! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1215">  GOLD Stick, that is what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1216">  Gold Stick is very complimentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1217">  In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1218">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1219">“Let us put it into the fire! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1220">” said the other boy, “it will help to boil the kettle. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1221">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1222">So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1223">“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1224">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1225">“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1226">The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1227">  At last, however, the fire caught him. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1228">“Now I am going off! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1229">” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1230">  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1231">  In fact, I shall go so high that—” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1232">Fizz!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1233">Fizz!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1234">Fizz!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1235">and he went straight up into the air. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1236">“Delightful! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1237">” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1238">  What a success I am! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1239">” </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1240">But nobody saw him. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1241">Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1242">“Now I am going to explode,” he cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1243">  “I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1244">”  And he certainly did explode. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1245">  Bang!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1246">Bang!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1247">Bang!  </span><span class="sentence" id="en1248">went the gunpowder. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1249">  There was no doubt about it. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1250">But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1251">Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1252">“Good heavens! </span><span class="sentence" id="en1253">” cried the Goose. </span><span class="sentence" id="en1254">  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she rushed into the water. </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="en1255">“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he went out. </span></p>
